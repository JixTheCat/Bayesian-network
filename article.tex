% The research for this project has identified that there is no uniform
% way to measure sustainability, no uniform agreement on indicators
% that could be used for measurement and even less agreement on
% which metrics should be used to quantify these indicators. This is
% best demonstrated that of the 72 triple bottom line frameworks, the
% indicator water occurred in 64 of these frameworks, although there
% appeared to be no standard metric identified to measure how water
% was measured. This is an endemic problem with sustainability
% measurement.

% The forces which drive the social, economic and environmental sectors, the decision-makers who have the power or influence to accept or reject change, cannot be ignored, if change is to be achieved (van Kerkhoff and Lebel, 2006).It may be that part of the problem with the progress of sustainable development in the past has been the traditional divide between those undertaking the systematic research and those on the ground required to take up and act on the results of such. The dissemination of research results has usually only occurred on completion, in a unidirectional, linear communication (van Kerkhoff and Lebel, 2006), whereas, as grounded researchers explain, the ownership of ideas and a willingness to implement these relies on a more collaborative approach from the outset, before research has even commenced. It requires acknowledging that experts exist in all spheres and need to be able to share information and debate, in order to come to agreement on issues, assessment tools, priorities for remediation and an optimal approach to solving problems (Corbin and Strauss, 2008; Johnson and Mengersen, 2009), e.g. improving sustainability.

% The sustainability Bayesian network model was constructed using
% open source software and has been delivered as a software package.
% A future project could focus on making it easier for a wider range of
% relevant stakeholders to engage with the model. For example a
% graphical user interface to the model could be developed and
% then web-enabled so that stakeholders can readily interact with the
% model and run scenarios.

% The concept of sustainability has been described as the most
% challenging policy concept ever developed (Spangenberg, 2004).
% There are more than 100 definitions of sustainability and sustainable
% development (Labuschagne et al., 2005). The most frequently cited
% definition comes from the pivotal 1987 World Commission on
% Environment and Development ‘Brundtland Report’, ‘development
% that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability
% of future generations to meet their own needs’ (WCED, 1987).


% It is necessary to understand the impacts of each system on one another, for example, the impact of industries on climate change, diminishing resources, economic shifts and social change. In turn, it is necessary to understand the impact of variables such as these on an industry, its future viability, its surrounding communities and the economies they feed or depend on (Brundtland, 2007). Thus, a tool is required that can measure complexity within and between systems and model how changes in one element, positive or negative, might flow on to others. Only then can strategies for sustainability be developed with reduced risk of unintended negative consequences (Johnson and Mengersen, 2012).

% Self-organising systems.
%
% Sustainability is one such complex system. It comprises complex interacting factors and processes (e.g. in the context of the dairy study: farm, factory and market processes; and environmental, social and economic factors). It is self-organising; it does not require external intervention to thrive or deteriorate (e.g. an ecosystem can be sustainable through self-organisation). It can also exhibit emergent behaviour, since intervening in one part of the sustainability system can have unintended and quite extreme effects in seemingly unrelated parts of the system (Johnson and Mengersen, 2012).

% These systems are exactly what you think they are. It is described in physics, chemistry, social sciences and philosophy.
