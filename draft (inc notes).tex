% \section{Preamble notes}

% What is your topic?
The topic of this paper is the environmental sustainability of vineyards within Australia.
% What is the context for your reserach?
The context of this research is that the Australian wine sector in general has gone through many tribulations due to economic, environmental and social pressures. Previously we attempted to highlight areas of concern through the use of statistical models, which were able to show strong correlations between various environmental and economic factors. However, discussions with industry and experts helped to identify that these relationships were not entirely causal, with some management and process of winegrowers obfuscating effects by directly addressing them. A key example of this was the lack of water use change during drought periods due to various methods that were used to obtain either more water or to circumvent the detrimental effects of lacking water resources.
% What do you want to achieve?
The identification of key factors; and their relation and contribution, direct or indirect, to the environmental sustainability of Australian winegrowing.
% Are there any relationships you want to explore?
This is key to this study. The relationships are in many ways more important to the research than the effects.


% Description
% NB Avoid titles along the lines of: “Effects of ...”, “The role of ...”, etc.  Be specific about the effect and its significance so that your reader knows what is on offer.

% For example, rather than write a title like “The effect of factor X on astrophysical properties of green cheese.”, 

% be specific about the effect and write something more like ...

% “Factor X halves the lunar thermal diffusivity of  green cheese”.

% You will usually find it easier to write an effective title if you make your title a sentence.

% Question %
%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Things to consider
%
% Why is the knowledge important?
% This was identified as a gap within our own prior research and is helpful in creating a basis for scenario assessment and comparison. This will allow a greater understanding of how these factors change within different scenarios; whether that be climate, region, business goal.
% % What is the significance?
% The significance is to bridge the gap between correlations and data to causal relationships. To inform growers using factors that are within their control, or how factors within their control are indfuenced by natural phenomenon.
% % How will the findings be utilised?
% These findings will be used to help inform the wider winegrowing community of what factors are most significant to environmental outcomes, and how they interact with one another. In practice this study aids a grower through informing them of how decisions impact environmental outcomes and how changing circumstance contribute to these factors and outcomes.
% % What improvements may be derived from this result?
% A wider more informed understanding of contributing factors to environmental impact and how different factors relate to one another to contribute to these findings.
% % Are the terms well defined?
% The terms are well defined. This was a key outcome of this project.
% % Do experts think your question is important/relevant/doable?
% Experts helped to guide this decision, and changed the trajectory of this project in response to data presented and how well they believed they could inform the study.

% % What is the nature of your question?
% %         who, what, where, when, why, how?
% What are the key factors that contribute to environmental impact within the Australian winegrowing industry?
% How do these key factors relate to each other and what are the factors that influence them?
% What are the decision that can be made by growers that can change the environmental outcomes of their vineyards?
% How do these factors chagne across well understood scenarios?
% % You can have more than one question.

% % What is the most important question your paper will pose?
% What are the key factors to environmental impact within the Australian winegrowing industry, and how are these factors related?
% % NB It is essential that your answer is framed as a direct question.  Your response must end with a question mark.

% % Why is the question/issue/problem worth examining?
% By examining the key and relevant factors to vineyards' environmental impacts we can better prepare for future changes in climate pressure, economic restrictions; that is we can better use this model to assess the potential environmental outcomes of the wine industry, as informed by experts, given potential upcoming challenges or changes.
% % Briefly outline the problem you are tackling and explain why the problem is important to knowledge in general.  “Nothing much is known” is not sufficient justification by itself.  You have to show why the gap in knowledge is important.  Expect to draw heavily on your reading of the literature in framing your answer but do not get into detail of  author and year.
% The collection of data and subsequent statistical analytics can only go so far as to fill the gap between cause and effects within wiengrowing. This research helps to fully understand the relevant decisions being made, how they are informed and what the known outcomes are. This helps to align these results to data collected to show stronger causal relationships than pure correlative, or hypothetical postulations of statistical analysis.

% Introduction?

% This research provides valuable insights and data that can inform and guide decisions made by policymakers and industry leaders in the Australian winegrowing sector. By identifying key sustainability factors and their interactions, this study offers evidence-based recommendations that can support the development of more effective and sustainable agricultural practices and policies.

% The research for this project has identified that there is no uniform
% way to measure sustainability, no uniform agreement on indicators
% that could be used for measurement and even less agreement on
% which metrics should be used to quantify these indicators. This is
% best demonstrated that of the 72 triple bottom line frameworks, the
% indicator water occurred in 64 of these frameworks, although there
% appeared to be no standard metric identified to measure how water
% was measured. This is an endemic problem with sustainability
% measurement.

% The forces which drive the social, economic and environmental sectors, the decision-makers who have the power or influence to accept or reject change, cannot be ignored, if change is to be achieved (van Kerkhoff and Lebel, 2006).It may be that part of the problem with the progress of sustainable development in the past has been the traditional divide between those undertaking the systematic research and those on the ground required to take up and act on the results of such. The dissemination of research results has usually only occurred on completion, in a unidirectional, linear communication (van Kerkhoff and Lebel, 2006), whereas, as grounded researchers explain, the ownership of ideas and a willingness to implement these relies on a more collaborative approach from the outset, before research has even commenced. It requires acknowledging that experts exist in all spheres and need to be able to share information and debate, in order to come to agreement on issues, assessment tools, priorities for remediation and an optimal approach to solving problems (Corbin and Strauss, 2008; Johnson and Mengersen, 2009), e.g. improving sustainability.

% The sustainability Bayesian network model was constructed using
% open source software and has been delivered as a software package.
% A future project could focus on making it easier for a wider range of
% relevant stakeholders to engage with the model. For example a
% graphical user interface to the model could be developed and
% then web-enabled so that stakeholders can readily interact with the
% model and run scenarios.

% The concept of sustainability has been described as the most
% challenging policy concept ever developed (Spangenberg, 2004).
% There are more than 100 definitions of sustainability and sustainable
% development (Labuschagne et al., 2005). The most frequently cited
% definition comes from the pivotal 1987 World Commission on
% Environment and Development ‘Brundtland Report’, ‘development
% that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability
% of future generations to meet their own needs’ (WCED, 1987).


% It is necessary to understand the impacts of each system on one another, for example, the impact of industries on climate change, diminishing resources, economic shifts and social change. In turn, it is necessary to understand the impact of variables such as these on an industry, its future viability, its surrounding communities and the economies they feed or depend on (Brundtland, 2007). Thus, a tool is required that can measure complexity within and between systems and model how changes in one element, positive or negative, might flow on to others. Only then can strategies for sustainability be developed with reduced risk of unintended negative consequences (Johnson and Mengersen, 2012).

% Initiatives to improve the environmental impacts of the Australian Wine industry have been ongoing since the 1990s; with recommendations to implement strategies for national programs that would help educate industry members in sustainable practices (Keith Jones, 2002). The first legislative initiative to support national programs was the Environmental Management Guidelines for Vineyards in Western Australia during 2002 (Nind, 2002). The first national program was the Australian Wine Industry Stewardship, beginning shortly after, during 2004 (WFA, 2009). This program was replaced multiple times during the 2000s, first by the Australian Wine Environmental Stewardship, and then by EnviroWine, finally becoming EntWine in 2009. The period in the 2000s was further influenced by several key researchers and program leaders, where concurrently multiple regions developed approaches to sustainable management tied to sustainability programs (SWA, 2023). EntWine was eventually acquired by the Australian Wine Research Institute and Australian Grape & Wine during 2015; which would lead to its redevelopment into Sustainable Winegrowing Australia (SWA) during 2019/2020 (SWA, 2023).
%             2.1.2. Previous Research and Motivation
% During the period of 2010 to 2023 data was collected voluntarily from wine industry members through the national sustainability programs, ultimately being in SWA possession as of 2023. The data set was used in 2020 to analyse sustainable practices, resulting in the development of a Resource Intensity Score (RIS); where the RIS was a summary indicator value of a vineyard’s energy use, emissions and water use (Nayak et al., 2020). The analysis then fit vineyards’ RIS values to 55 variables sourced from 23 separate wine regions during the period of 2015 to 2018 through the use of Stepwise Regression modelling. It was found that the top 10% gross margin vineyards had a lower operating cost and a lower RIS score than vineyards in the bottom 10% gross margin.
% The motivation for this thesis is to investigate the differences between the top 10% gross margin vineyards and those of the bottom 10%, hoping to uncover what the key differences were and to relate them to sustainable practices; as there is a known gap in the literature due to the difficulty to evaluate relationships using empirical evidence of both the environmental and economic impacts of sustainable practices in viticulture. This difficulty stems from data scarcity, industry complexity and transparency. While there have been attempts to fill these gaps, methodologies and indicators have lacked in ability to compare different regions and scales (Baiano, 2021).
%             2.1.3. Economic Pressures
% Historically strong demands for Australian wine have helped to create a thriving industry, however recently sharp reductions in exports to mainland China due to significant deposit tariffs have caused  a decline of 19% in Australian export value during the 2021-2022 financial year (see Figure 1) (Wine Australia, 2022). The pressure brought on by the drop in export value has been exacerbated by loss of tourism and labour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, global freight crisis, war in Europe and rising inflation (Wine Australia, 2021a, 2020). These pressures within the wine industry have trickled down to vineyards, where winemakers retain unwanted wine, creating an oversupply of grapes. Currently the proposed strategy to soften pressures proposed by Wine Australia includes initiatives focused on market diversification, and sustainability to build resilience in the coming years. 
% Figure 1:  The exports of Australian wine over time in Australian Dollars Free On Board, comparing exports between China and the rest of the world. This graphic is taken from the Wine Australia Annual Report of 2020-21(Wine Australia, 2022).
%             2.1.4. Environmental Pressures
% There are several environmental concerns that affect viticulture, including loss of soil quality, lack of rain, hail, disease, fire, and frost; with climate change exacerbating these issues. In 2020, 40,000 tonnes of grapes were lost across 18 different wine regions due to bush fires and smoke taint; the predicted incidence of wildfires is expected to increase (Canadell et al., 2021). In comparison to countrywide pressures such as drought, this damage made up only 3% of the total amount of grapes for that year; although acknowledged as a considerable loss on an individual basis, it was deemed to be only a minor national concern by Wine Australia when compared to other environmental pressures such as drought (Wine Australia, 2020).

\section{Title}
A Bayesian Network Model based decision support tool for Environmental Sustainability in the Australian Winegrowing Industry.

\section{Abstract}

Environmental sustainability in the Australian winegrowing industry involves complex, interacting factors. To address this, we developed a Bayesian Network (BN) model, integrating data and expert input to summarise key factors, their relationships, and impacts on vineyard outcomes. The BN model was iteratively refined, involving variable selection, structure definition, and probability estimation, with expert input ensuring industry relevance and regional adaptability. A case study of the Coonawarra region highlighted regional differences while underscoring industry-wide concerns, such as agrochemical use. The BN model, accessible via an application, allows for continuous industry feedback and adaptation. Future research should explore dynamic BNs to address temporal variations and extend applicability to other regions. This study underscores the potential of BNs as powerful tools for sustainability analysis in agriculture, offering valuable insights for sustainable vineyard management.

\section{Introduction}

The imperative for environmental sustainability in agriculture has intensified as the sector strives to balance productivity with ecological preservation~\cite{baianoOverviewSustainabilityWine2021,corboEnvironmentalSustainabilityPrograms2014}. This is especially true for Viticulture, the cultivation of grapevines for wine production, as it presents unique challenges and opportunities for sustainability, particularly due to its position as a luxury good amongst other agricultural industries~\cite{longbottomExploringLinksSustainability2018,ferraraLifeCycleAssessment2018}. This study investigates environmental sustainability practices in Australian winegrowing, using the application of Bayesian Networks (BNs). A broader model of Australian winegrowing was created, with a more specific case study looking at the Coonawarra winegrowing region being conducted to create a rigorous and quantitative approach to understanding sustainable practices and the relationships between these factors.

Bayesian Networks are probabilistic models that effectively capture and analyse the interactions between multiple factors in complex systems~\cite{korbBayesianArtificialIntelligence2011}. By integrating expert knowledge and region-specific data, BNs were able to provide a structured framework to quantify the impacts of various factors on sustainability within Australian winegrowing. This methodology not only shed light on current sustainability practices but also identified critical areas for intervention through illustrating the interconnectedness of each of the factors and how they directly or indirectly influence one another.

This research is guided by several fundamental inquiries aimed at enhancing our understanding of environmental sustainability in viticulture. A primary question is how key factors impacting environmental sustainability can be rigorously defined and quantified. Another focus delves into identifying the unique regional characteristics of different regions, using the Coonawarra winegrowing region to illustrate how factors influence might change regionally. Additionally, the study investigates how these factors interact within a Bayesian Network model, providing a framework for understanding their complex interdependencies. The final question, looks at how the findings from these Bayesian Network models compare with existing literature on sustainability in viticulture, aiming to connect industry perceptions to academic knowledge.

The industry panel was used as a catalyst in the early stages of this research to help explore these multifaceted questions. A comprehensive literature review was compiled through both structured searches. This extensive review established a foundational understanding of the current knowledge landscape and identified major concepts within sustainable winegrowing. To ensure a robust and comprehensive approach, a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods were employed within the creation of the BN; this included expert consultations and data analysis, which were instrumental in the BNs construction and validation. The consultations were done through the use of An industry panel comprising experts in viticulture and environmental sustainability, which provided insights and guidance throughout the research process. Their expertise was crucial in defining and quantifying the key factors, and further understanding the specific regional characteristics to Coonawarra. Through the integration of industry knowledge and academic research this study aimed to produce findings that are not only theoretically sound but also practically relevant and applicable to the viticulture industry.

% The results section presents an in-depth analysis of The Coonawarra case study, highlighted significant factors identified by the BN and their interactions. Key factors such as water quality, pest and disease management, market pressures, agrochemical use, and climate/weather conditions were found to be the most influential on environmental sustainability in the region. Comparative analysis with another case study BN and existing literature underscores the robustness and relevance of our findings.

% This study provides critical insight into enhancing environmental sustainability through informed decision-making and targeted interventions by highlighting the sensitivity of different factors to the environmental sustainability of vineyards. The findings have significant implications for the local viticulture industry and offer a replicable framework for other agricultural sectors aiming to achieve sustainability.

\section{Methods}

In agriculture, the consideration of environment is critical to the success of the industry. The question of environmental sustainability has continued to grow in importance as the industry is affected by international market demands, disease pressures, natural disasters and social change \citep{wineaustraliaNationalVintageReport2022,wineaustraliaNationalVintageReport2020,wineaustraliaNationalVintageReport2021,cassonMultidisciplinaryApproachAssess2022}. The question of sustainability requires the consideration of a multitude of factors, not only due to physical differences between locations/habitats but also due to priorities driven by a myriad of perspectives from as consumers, ecosystems, government and industry \citep{baianoOverviewSustainabilityWine2021,wayeCarbonFootprintsFood2008}. It is important to consider each factor with respect to its relevant perspectives, and to be explicit in how each of these factors and perspectives are defined \citep{santiago-brownSustainabilityAssessmentWineGrape2015}.

Collaboration between experts from different perspectives is a useful method to reconcile opinions of the significance of different factors and their contribution to sustainable outcomes \citep{dichiaraCollaborativeApproachAchieving2024}. In Australia, the views of both industry and consumer are united in their priority to improve greenhouse gas emissions and resource inputs through approaches such as regulating chemicals, water use and fertilisers \citep{dumbrellComparingAustralianPublic2024}. While there is a general agreement on broader regulatory needs, the industry requirements vary greatly between different wine regions; due to climate, soil types and water resources \citep{abbalDecisionSupportSystem2016,agostaRegionalClimateVariability2012}.

Methods for measuring sustainability comprise a wide variety of approaches with the use of index systems being common \citep{gehringerMappingSustainabilityMeasurement2024}. Other approaches utilise the identification of key factors, and their measurements as a proxy to indicate impact to, or the health of, the environment \citep{floresWhatSustainabilityWine2018}. The measuring of sustainability through the use of these tools can help to manage risk and promote resilience for industries through identifying sustainable goals and key factors of interest that contribute to positive outcomes \citep{klemesAssessingMeasuringEnvironmental2015, beckerSustainabilityScienceManaging2024}. Within this study we focus on measuring key factors and establishing how they interact, and ultimately effect the surrounding environment; the chosen method for this study is a Bayesian Network.

\subsection{Literature Review}

The literature review was a crucial component of this study, designed to establish a comprehensive understanding of existing knowledge on environmental sustainability in viticulture. The review aimed to identify key factors influencing sustainability, understanding their interactions, and to compare findings with the results obtained from the Bayesian Network and expert definitions.

A systematic search strategy was employed to ensure a thorough review of the literature. The search included multiple academic journals; with search terms being broadly based on key factors given from the industry panel. This approach was used capture a wide range of relevant literature, incorporating keywords associated with viticulture, sustainability, and other agricultural operations related to the definitions provided by the expert panel. The general query (adapted to different formats for various journals and bibliographic databases) used for the literature search was:

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

To ensure the relevance and quality of the literature reviewed, specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Articles were only excluded if they were not available in full text or were not written in English. Journals beyond those included were also examined especially where they offered in-depth reviews of sustainability within agriculture or winegrowing; methodological reviews within this context were also included.

Once relevant articles were identified, data extraction was conducted to gather information on the key factors influencing environmental sustainability in viticulture, their interactions, and the methodologies used in previous studies. The extracted data was then processed using Leximancer to identify common themes and concepts in the existing literature.

An expert panel comprising specialists in viticulture and environmental sustainability was engaged throughout the literature review process. The panel provided guidance on the selection of relevant articles, helped refine the inclusion criteria through their list of key factors. By conducting a thorough literature review, this study aimed to build a solid foundation of existing knowledge, identify gaps, and position the findings from the Bayesian Network models within the broader context of sustainability research in viticulture. This approach ensured that the study's results were not only robust and scientifically sound but also practically relevant and actionable for industry stakeholders.

\subsection{Bayesian Networks}

A Bayesian Network is a graphical model, being comprised of nodes and edges. Uniquely, Bayesian Networks contain the network's operations within the nodes themselves instead of across the edges. This is done in the form of probability tables, with connections being informed by the edges. There is simplicity within the calculations done within a node, as it is fundamentally achieved through sum and division operations. However, great complexity is introduced when a node is informed by many parents, which can also have many parents themselves. The change in a single parent node effects all children of the network; often resulting in intractable systems, especially when nodes may have numerous classes \citep{korbBayesianArtificialIntelligence2011}. The strength of this complexity over simple operations, is the ability to encapsulate incredibly complex systems with simple definitions.

The use of a Bayesian Network allows for the ability to include perspectives from industry experts and create a causal structure. The graphical nature of the Bayesian Network also helps to illustrate factors within the model and communicate the complexity and relationships of factors to one another; and ultimately a factor's relation direct or indirect, to a vineyard's environmental impact \citep{pourretBayesianNetworksPractical2008}. Furthermore, data collected across Australia could also be used to help inform both scenarios and the model alongside expert opinion.

The calculations of a Bayesian Network are based on Bayes' theorem, shown as follows
\begin{equation}\label{bayesformula}
P(A|B)= {P(B|A)P(A)}\over{P(B)}
\end{equation}.

Where we calculate the probability of an event A given an event B, as demonstrated by \cite{bayesLIIEssaySolving1763}. Within a Bayesian Network, an event can be considered any given node and its outcome one of the node's classes. Events are connected by edges within the network, with each node containing the probability of an outcome given parent nodes' outcomes. This is an iterative application of \ref{bayesformula}, which can be achieved through

\begin{equation}
        \mathbb(P) (X_{1}=x_{1},...X_{n}=x_{n})=\prod_{n}^{i=1}p(x_{i}|x_{Parents(i)})
\end{equation},
for a selected node $i$ given the parents and their local conditional distributions.

The iterative nature, or the ability to show the difference in probable outcomes of different sets of events and their uncertainty allows for the ability to conduct inference. This type of Bayesian inference shows the difference between the likelihood of various outcomes with and without different evidence of prior nodes outcomes being present. The sets of different outcomes then stored as a joint probability distribution, which can be decomposed into the conditional probabilities of each set of possible events occurring and their likelihoods.

One of the greatest abilities within this style of inference is Marginalization. In which, the outcome of a particular event can be determined irrespective of other outcomes. This type of marginalisation is intuitively represented as nodes conditional independence is illustrated inherently through the structure of the graph by its edges.

Bayesian Networks created in this study were created using BayesFusion \citep{bayesfusionGeNIeModelerUSER2022} to calculate the networks and their probabilities. The use of Bayes fuse software was used both through the GUI interface and the SMILE API \citep{bayesfusionGeNIeModelerUSER2022} system using C++ \citep{ISO:2012:III}.

\subsection{Elicitation}

The Bayesian Network was constructed using a mixture of data and expert elicitation. The format followed recommendations from \cite{korbBayesianArtificialIntelligence2011,pitchforthProposedValidationFramework2013}. Where, we progressed iteratively through from problem definition, to structure, to parametarisation, and then to validation. Experts were initially informed regarding the process to establish an understanding of what each step would be comprised of, as well as highlighting common pitfalls and how we would address them. With common problems being listed by both authors being:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item Not understanding the problem context
        \item complexity without value
        \item Getting arc directions wrong
        \item too many parent nodes
        \item Bias expert estimates
        \item Inconsistent probabilities
        \item Being absolutely certain
\end{enumerate}
To address these issues, experts were kept well-informed of them, as well as variable definitions and problem scope. Open communication was maintained during the entire process to help answer questions regarding the model, process, and to maintain transparency. Communication included in-person and electronic one-on-ones and group sessions; with elicitation of expert knowledge being primarily conducted through a series of workshops with the panel of industry experts.

Each workshop had a primary focus such as: scope, structure or parameterisation; with, prior concepts being built upon iteratively. The first important establishment was the scope of the network, and how well it could or couldn't be adapted to a wide variety of circumstances within the Australian winegrowing industry. Following this was the discussion around the structure of the network, which entailed the description of relationships and stricter definitions of each factor to one another. Finally, variables were paramatised using conditional probabilities.

To introduce new concepts and how they interacted, preliminary simplified versions (strawman examples) were provided to experts; with the intention of these examples to be examined, critiqued, and improved upon. The use of these strawman examples enabled a more engaged and effective review process. Experts were initially able to interact with elements of the model and see how they worked together. The strawman examples were crafted from a foundation of literature and data to offer a basic, layman's understanding of key factors and concepts, serving as a starting point for further development and discussion. 

\subsection{CPT interpolating}

As is often the case, the most arduous endeavour is to attribute probabilities to events defined within the Bayesian Network \citep{korbBayesianArtificialIntelligence2011}. Due to the growing complexity of the network throughout the study each event was described by binary classes. With the classes depicting a positive or negative contribution to a vineyard's environmental outcome. Furthermore, the complexity of the variables, particularly water use, were overwhelmingly interrelated to operations across the vineyard. To attempt to capture this complexity but not dilute the ability to work with various scenarios the conditional probabilities were interpolated.

This method utilised interpolation between two anchored points. One point represented the case of all factors being true/positive and the other represented all factors being false/negative. The interpolation was achieved by designating each factor an attributed weight; where, weights were indicative of a factor's overall influence to its child node. During workshop discussion participants were the most comfortable using scores out of 10 to describe a factor's influence on its child node.

Using this method, any given probability can be calculated using
\begin{equation}
        p=x\sum_{i}^{n} + y\sum_{m}^{i} 
\end{equation},
for n number of true or contributing factors and m false or not contributing factors. We know the solutions for when all contributing factors are true ($p_t$) or all were false ($p_f$). Where,
\begin{equation}
        p_t=x\sum_{i}^{n} 
        \text{ and }
        p_f=y\sum_{m}^{i}
\end{equation}.
From here values for $x$ and $y$ are able to be derived using the sum of the provided weights.

\subsection{Validation}

The method for validation sought to address concerns presented by \citep{pitchforthProposedValidationFramework2013}; who listed the following:  nomological, face, content, concurrent, convergent, discriminant and predictive validity. Validation steps were partly incorporated during the process of constructing the Bayesian network itself. Specifically when considering the nomological validity of the network; the expert panel was asked directly regarding its ability to extrapolate beyond a single region, or scenario. In part, the selection process for experts, aspired to be diverse within their regional knowledge and expertise in an attempt to broaden the ability to critique choices. Although it was agreed that multiple scenarios were well captured by the trees structure, minor additions would be needed to encapsulate the differences between specific winegrowing regions. This requirement aligned with literature, which highlighted how regional variation is considered a driving factor for many vineyard outcomes and priorities \citep{abbalDecisionSupportSystem2016,agostaRegionalClimateVariability2012,soarClimateDriversRed2008}.

The Face and content validity of the network was questioned directly by the expert panel through the structure and conditional probability phases. The choice of binary discretisation was due to two reasons; that it captured the relevant contribution to the node in question and limited the model from becoming to overly complex and circumstantial. This helped to avoid some overtly specific scenarios in favour for broader vineyard decisions, whilst allowing the model to address these behaviours in the future by specifically targeting a region and incorporating its considerations. This approach went hand in hand with the content validation. Where, it was found that the limitation of the model was primarily regional, which aligned again with the findings of other researchers \citep{abbalDecisionSupportSystem2016,ellisUsingBayesianGrowth2020,agostaRegionalClimateVariability2012,barriguinhaVineyardYieldEstimation2021,brockRelationSoilOrganic2011}. Specifically, the question of water resources, which was central to the model and highly interrelated \citep{carmonaUseParticipatoryObjectOriented2011}.

Similarly, the convergent validity of the model was accomplished through the broader discretisation of nodes into the binary forms of positive and negative affects on the environmental impact of the vineyard. This manner of discretisation allowed a clear delineation in localised subnetworks within the model. The alignment of the model to other research helped to further answer questions of concurrent validation. In that, it was found that other studies emphasised the same variables selected by our experts. This was especially true regarding the consideration of yield and regional factors that influence vineyard outcomes \cite{abbalDecisionSupportSystem2016,campsGrapeHarvestYield2012,hallWithinseasonTemporalVariation2011}. Furthermore, these types of variables are highly prevalent in greater agriculture studies that emphasise general outcomes and resource use such as yield and water respectively \citep{heFruitYieldPrediction2022,laurentLocalInfluenceClimate2022}.

The discriminant validation of the model was the most difficult, as the definitions of each node changed over the course of the model's inception. This brought the difficulty that nodes connected by edges would have to be reconsidered each time a definition changed. This issue was simply overcome through explicit definitions accessible to all participants, and by directly addressing issues caused by definitions before further development of the model. Again, the simplicity of binary state nodes helped to isolate definitions more distinctly, as well as employing methods such as node splitting, removal and adding additional nodes \citep{korbBayesianArtificialIntelligence2011}.

The structure of the model itself was similar to other models in the presence of variables but differed in some of their relation due to the terminal node being environmental impact. The paramitisation of the nodes did differ to other studies, as every node was related and thought of with regard, to the terminal node and how they subsequently affected the environmental outcomes of a vineyard and not other more prevalent outcomes such as yield \citep{laurentReviewIssuesMethods2021}. The discriminant validity of the model was highlighted through the acknowledgement of the model's requirement to be tuned to any specific wine region before being able to be properly employed. Furthermore, the predictive validity was able to be well established through two methods, the use of a case study and the consideration of extreme outcomes.

\subsection{Sensitivity analysis}

The sensitivity analysis conducted in this study utilised the Bayesian Network software GeNie, implementing the algorithm developed by \cite{article}; an optimisation of \autocite{Castillo1996ANM} and \cite{Gaag1998PracticableSA}. The method allows for efficient computation of the influence of parameter variations on the output probabilities of a Bayesian network, making it particularly suitable for complex models. Sensitivity was calculated on the terminal node 'Environmental Impact' to reflect its sensitivity to changes in other nodes.

The process utilises two outward and an inward propagation across a junction tree, a data structure representing the Bayesian network. These propagations are essential for establishing the necessary cliques that allow for the calculation of the sensitivity function using the coefficients $\gamma$ and $\delta$.

These coefficients are used in determining evidence through

\begin{equation}
y = {{p(a, e)(x)}\over{p(e)(x)}}={{\alpha x + \beta}\over{\gamma x + \delta}}
\end{equation}.

Where $y$ is the posterior marginal of interest, given evidence $e$, with respect to the parameter $x$. 

% should I extrapolate on this method?

% y - a posterior marginal of interest
% e - evidence
% x - all possible probability parameters
% a - node of interest
% $$ y = p(a|e)$$

% $$ y = \alpha x + \beta $$

% marginal distribution of any given parent node of a - any given node parent of a
% b - the ith given parent node of a
% pi - the parent nodes of the b ith node
% $$ x = p(b_{i}|\pi) $$

% $$ p(e)(x) = \gamma x + \delta $$

% For each parameter under investigation, the sensitivity function 
% $$ y=\alpha x + \beta x $$

% y=αx+βγx+δy=γx+δαx+β​ is determined, where yy represents the posterior marginal probability, and xx is the parameter in question. The coefficients (αα, ββ, γγ, δδ) in this function are computed using the results from the propagations, ensuring computational efficiency.

The methodology is extendable to n-way sensitivity analysis, allowing for the examination of the joint effects of multiple parameters. This involves identifying the relevant parameters and their influence on the posterior marginals using the same propagation strategy multiple times.

By employing this method, the sensitivity analysis avoids the extensive computational demands of traditional brute-force approaches, which require numerous network evaluations. Instead, this approach ensures that all potential parameters are considered with minimal computational overhead; allowing the use of multiple scenarios based off different evidence.

\subsection{Case study: Coonawarra}

Due to the regional limitations of the model, experts proposed a case study of a specific and well understood region: Coonawarra in South Australia. The choice of the region was due to the prevalence of data within and around the region, as well as experts' understanding of the region's unique challenges and benefits to winegrowing. The Coonawarra BN was built off of the original Bayesian Network's structure with site specific conditional probabilities being entered and scrutinised by the expert panel. Difference in factor interactions were further discussed by the panel, resulting in two distinct BN models that influenced two types of approaches; primarily differing between opportunity based tractor use for undervine operations and more purposeful undervine management, as well as the inclusion of further soil based factors that could be significant for particular sites.

% \subsection{Methods notes}

% \citep{mayfieldDesigningExpertledBayesian2023} -> this reference also uses a similar method which we can cite alongside everything else.
% % These are transcribed notes from Korb & Nicholson:

% \citep{korbBayesianArtificialIntelligence2011} Korb & Nicholson describe three major issues in the creation of Bayesian Networks though knowledge Engineering:
% - Generating Arc Structure
% - Parametarisation
% - dealing with utilities

% Each element within the elicitation process was iteratively 
% Elicitation was conduct ach  Although workshops focussed on a single issue, it was important to continually address each issue in an iterative fashion. The approach to ensuring a sound and sane network, was to directly address common issues that occur during the construction of Bayesian Networks using ellicitation as outlined by #TODO: Korb and Nicholson. These issues are similarly highlighted by #:TODO: Pitchforth.

% Transparency with the expert panel was a key ingredient with this approach, highlighting explicitly what these problems were and how we would overcome them. This included agreeing upon definitions of each node before connecting edges between them.

% Although originally multiclass nodes existed, the bayesian network was altered to only include binary class nodes. Each edge between a node had to answer the following questions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%         \item Are the nodes in the BN the right ones?
%         % \item Are the state spaces (values) for each node correct?
%         \item Are the arcs right?
% \end{enumerate}
% If the answer to any of the above questions was no; then the structure was not considered sufficiently defined. Although we explicitly defined the structure of the BN prior to CPT parametarisation. This process continued when adding conditionaly probability values. The entire process of construction iinvolved the steps:
% \begin{enumerate}
%         \item exposing the panel to a strawman argument/model/definition
%         \item Outlining the model and the process involved in defining the structure of a BN
%         \item The expert panel reviewing possible nodes and arcs and definitions
%         \item Defining their own structure, node or term.
%         \item Agreeing upon the final definition, structure or model.
% \end{enumerate}
% \subsubsection{Trying to build the full model all at once}

% Korb & Nicholson say that it is nearly impossible to build a complex BN all in one go. They recommend:
% \begin{enumerate}
%         \item dividing models into subcomponents
%         \item breaking down the problem into a single target variable
%         \item reducing the scope of the problem
%         \item Setting a single time frame for the problem
% \end{enumerate}
% The strawman was presented as three subcomponents that pertained to the triple bottom line's environment, economy and social aspects.
% Within the first workshop it was agreed on by the expert panel to reduce the scope from a triple bottom line to only reviewing the environmental impacts of vineyards. This also reduced the BN to a single terminal node. It was further decided to create the BN as a single season to limit its complexity.

% \subsubsection{The problem}
% \subsubsection{Not understanding the problem context, complexity without value.}
% It is crucial to gain a clear understanding of the problem and its context. This can be seen as answering the following questions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%         \item what do you want to reason about?
%         \item What dont you know?
%         \item What information do you have?
%         \item What do you know?
% These questions are well addressed in prior research. The creation of baseline models showed strong linear relationships between many variables. The creation of XGBoosted trees uncovered the ability to well inform any particular variable but with no real causal structure or understandability. here we seek to pursue causality and link these variables together in a way that is more aligned with a decision support structure than purely as a predictive exercise.
% \subsubsection{Complexity without value}
% A very common impulse, when something is known about the problem, is to want to put it in the model. But including everything known, just because it is known, simply adds complexity to the model without adding any value (and in fact often reduces value). Instead, the knowledge engineer must focus on the problem:
% "Which of the known variables are most relevant to the problem?"
% - This issue in its the simplest form has attempted to be overcome through trying to mediate the workshop and inform experts of the potential problem that will come with a cumbersome model.
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsubsection{Structure - Nodes}
% The list below is each of the problems, which can be addressed together in some fashion as the approaches of solving them overlap.
% \begin{enumerate}
%         \item Getting the node values wrong
%         \item Node values aren't exhaustive
%         \item Node values aren't mutually exclusive
%         \item Incorrect modelling of mutually exclusive outcomes
%         \item Trying to model fuzzy categories
%         \item Confusing state and Probability
%         \item Confusion about what the node represents
% \end{enumerate}
% Two major strategies were employed to overcome these problems. Tying nodes explicitly to a data source that corroborated the definition and state in some manner as the node. For node s that did not have data set they were sought to be defined with an explicit explanation that experts agreed upon or had some external explanation such as legislation.

% \subsubsection{Structure Arcs}
% \subsubsection{Getting the arc directions wrong}
% Arc directions are commonly wrong for the following reasons:
% \begin{enumerate}
%         \item Modelling reasoning rather than causation
%         \item Inverting cause and effect
%         \item Missing variables
% \end{enumerate}
% To note: Korb and Nicholson do not actually suggest a method for overcoming these problems. There is an inherint risk in creating a model and not having knowledge of a missing variable or of a causation. It is important to acknowledge that there is always a possibility that causation is mixed up with reasoning, and that not all variables are always known.
% \subsubsection{Too many parents}
% Sometimes it is unavoidable that a node is affected by many factors, or other nodes. There are some methods to help overcome this such as divorcing, in which a node is created to capture the cumulative affects of several parents on a child. This technique was employed in the creation of the structure of the BN with the expert panel.

% \subsubsection{Parameters}
% \subsubsection{Experts estimates of probabilities are biased}
% \begin{enumerate}
%         \item Overconfidence: The attribution of higher than justifiable probabilities to nodes/events.
%         \indent The tendency to attribute higher than justifiable probabilities (\citep{lichtensteinCalibrationProbabilitiesState1982} 
%         \item Anchoring: The tendency towards higher/lower based off of an arbitrary point of comparison. "Anchoring" people at a higher or lower than normal prediction because of some assumption or example  \citep{kahnemanPsychologyPrediction1973}.
%         \item Availability: The assessing of an event as more probable than is justifiable becaues it is more memorable or noticeable \citep{tverskyJudgmentUncertaintyHeuristics1974}.

% \end{enumerate}
% We have attempted to overcome this with two methods. A diverse and varried expert panel. Those participanting have experience in multiple vineyards as managers and other duties as well as the panel itself having varied manager/owners from different regions and scale. With some experts being more specialised in specific areas such as agro-chemicals.
% \subsubsection{Inconsistent probabilities}
% The collection of probabilities for when the CPT is large can result in inconsistent probabilities. The collection of probabilities at different times or if probabilities are supplied by different experts can result in inconsistent probabilities as well.
% The use of desciptors such as very high or low can be of assistance \cite{vandergaag2013elicit}. In this study we overcame this through the use of worded response such as high and low. We then assigned probabilities to those broader cases. We had every expert agree upon each of the probabilities so that they could argue for or against any particular bias and so that the probabilities would even out to a more broader applicability, across all of the experts experiences.
% % \item Inconsistent "filling in" of large CPTs:
% -       -       - Being dead certain.
% \subsubsection{Incoherent probabilities (not summing to 1)}
% We used software that automatically detected incoherent probabilities when filling in the CPT values to overocme this problem.
% \subsubsection{Being dead certain}
% It is important that we limit over confidence (A quote form mark twain was used in the korb and Nicholson). 
% Our best defence against this was to use multiple experts with different experiences and to challenge them when something was certain. To ask why and to check in about their thoughts.

% \citep{morganUncertaintyGuideDealing1990}
% Two attributes of good elicitation process are:
% \begin{enumerate}
%         \item The expert should be apprised of what is known about the process, especially the nearly universal tendency to overcomefidence and other forms of bias. In order to avoid some problems, values should be elicited in random order and the expert not given feedback on how the different values fit together until a complet set has been elicited.
%         \item The elicitation process is not simply one of requesting and recording numbers but also one of the refining the definitions of variables and terms to be used in the model. What values are elicited depends directly upon the interpretation of terms and these should be made as explicit as possible and recorded during the elicitation. This is part of the process management described earlier.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Industry definitions}

The key factors identified were defined as shown in Table \ref{tab:definitions}. By utilising these definitions, each factor's contribution to environmental sustainability were quantified and assessed by the industry panel. The quantification of each factor allowed for a systematic assessment of their impacts. For example, "Water Use" was quantified as "High" or "Low," enabling a straightforward assessment of its environmental impact. Similarly, other factors were defined and quantified to ensure their contributions to sustainability were measurable; with each being of the two general categories ideal and not ideal (low and high respectively for water use).

% How can these key factors be rigorously defined so that they are quantifiable contributions to environmental sustainability?
% Purpose: Develop the factors into well-defined and measurable impacts on environmental sustainability.
% Results: Use the agreed upon definitions to fully realise factors and their impact.

By applying these definitions, the study effectively translated the qualitative aspects of environmental sustainability into usable metrics. This approach not only facilitated a comprehensive analysis of the factors but also identified their specific relationships. The use of these definitions enabled each of the factors' impacts to be linked and reviewed, demonstrating their importance in achieving environmental sustainability; allowing each factor's contribution to be clearly understood and relationships explicitly defined. This was key within the construction of the BN, were the industry panel could easily refer to the specifics of each definition and thus how it might relate to other factors.

\subsection{Key Factors Impacting Environmental Sustainability in Australian Winegrowing}

The relationships between the concepts defined by the industry panel are depicted in~\ref{figure:generalBN} as nodes in the Bayesian Network. The network highlights which factors are influenced by others in the form of an acyclic directed graph. Notably, the key factors influencing environmental impact centre around the application of agrochemical sprays, soil management, pest/disease and water. It also illustrates the complex nature of variables such as water and their interrelatedness.

\end{figure}

The BN provided a comprehensive overview of how factors defined by the industry panel, would interact. Showing not only direct relationships but also how changes in one factor can propagate through the network to affect others. This understanding is crucial for developing targeted interventions and policies aimed at improving sustainability in the winegrowing industry. This network illustrates the complexity of interactions that define environmental sustainability in Australian winegrowing. Furthermore, the extent of relationships helps to intrinsically show the importance of variables such as water; which is prolific in how it is interconnected with other vineyard aspects.

Figure~\ref{fig:generalBN}, illustrates the importance of water, disease/pests and climate through their prominent connections and numerous child nodes. Variables such as fuel use and soil management are resultant children nodes that connect these external pressures to decisions that offer potential solutions or interventions to aid in pursuing more sustainable outcomes.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis of Literature and Industry Perspectives}

The bibliometric analysis using Leximancer, revealed key concepts and their relevance to environmental sustainability in the Australian winegrowing industry. The most prominent concept was water (see Table \ref{tab:lexi}). The critical importance of other variables being measured by their comparative appearance in articles relative to water (making water 100\%).

% Comparing this with the data from Sustainable Winegrowing Australia (SWA), it was evident that the factors identified in the BN align with the critical areas SWA focuses on, such as water use, greenhouse gas emissions, and agrochemical use. This alignment reinforces the importance of these factors and supports the findings of the BN analysis.
% What are the relationships between these factors in the Australian winegrowing industry?
% 
% Purpose: Explore and understand the causal and correlated relationships among the factors.

The most significant concepts along with "water", included "change", "climate", and "disease". These terms highlight the focus on adapting to climate change and managing plant diseases, both of which are crucial for maintaining sustainable practices (see \ref{tab:lexi}). Furthermore, change and climate were kept separate to illustrate the variety of different changes, such as in practice, legislation and resource abundance. Additionally, although not in the top 10; "soil", "region", "practices", and "legislation" also appear to be dominant features within the literature. These factors are critical as they shape the environmental strategies employed by vineyards.

The prominence of different factors is visually described in Figure \ref{fig:lexi}, with the network depicting the frequency of these concepts appearing together. With the major concepts of these features being change, grapevine, water and land. These concepts illustrated the overarching theme between how the different concepts are connected, which showed very similar themes to that of the industry panel.

\end{figure}

A key difference between the concepts from Leximancer and the Bayesian Network was the rarity in how secondary and tertiary drivers of industry such as fuel or electricity use, were connected to primary sustainable concerns such as disease. With these concepts being related to the operations in fields as a result of changing practices or implementing different pest controls. Together these outputs provide a comprehensive overview of the key factors affecting environmental sustainability in the Australian winegrowing industry, offering valuable insights into areas of focus and potential improvement. This analysis underscores the multifaceted nature of sustainability, highlighting both the primary concerns and the interconnected secondary factors that must be managed on the ground.

\subsection{Sustainability specifics: Coonawarra Winegrowing}

Located in South Australia's Limestone Coast zone, Coonawarra is characterised by its cooler Australian climate and the unique geology of the limestone coast, which provides an excellent foundation for viticulture. The Coonawarra winegrowing region is renowned for its exceptional wine quality, particularly its Cabernet Sauvignon \cite{hallidayAustralianWineEncyclopedia2009}. Due to the region's distinct characteristics and the expert panels' expertise, this region was the ideal case study for applying Bayesian Networks using the expert panels overarching ideas around environmental sustainability practices to specific regional factors.

Identified key factors impacting environmental sustainability were examined with regard to Coonawarra. By comparing the generic Bayesian Network (Figure \ref{fig:b}) model to the Coonawarra-specific model (Figure \ref{fig:robyn} and Figure \ref{fig:marcel}), we identified regional characteristics that influence these variations. In this case study, we altered the general Australian BN to model and analyse the complex interactions between various environmental factors affecting wine production in Coonawarra. By incorporating industry-specific data and expert knowledge, the BN framework allowed us to quantify the impacts of key variables such as water use, agrochemical application, soil health, and climate conditions to each other. This approach not only aids in understanding the current sustainability status of the region but also helps in identifying potential areas for improvement and implementing effective management strategies. The resultant two models represent the final consensus, reflecting the diverse perspectives and occasionally differing viewpoints among the experts, necessitating the development of two distinct but complementary models.

    %     Sustainability in Coonawarra Winegrowing: Key Factors and Influences
    % #TODO: what are the regional specifics of coonawarra
    % How do the identified key factors vary across different wine regions in Australia, and what regional characteristics influence these variations?
    %     Purpose: Examine regional differences and tailor sustainability strategies.
    %     Results: Compare the generic model to the Coonawarra model. Acknowledge there is more work to be done here due to the amount of regions across Australia and the world. Prevous work also helps to illustrate these differences.

    % How do changes in key factors under various environmental and regulatory scenarios influence the overall environmental impact in Coonawarra?
    %     Purpose: Assess different factors overall influence to environmental sustainability given the definitions used.
    %     Results: Use the CPT values to assess the significant contribution of different variables on the BN and how that effects environmental sustainability.

The comparison reveals that while some factors, such as water use and agrochemical legislation, remain consistently significant, other factors such as soil show variation not only at a regional level but sometimes at the paddock level as described by the expert panel. Figure \ref{fig:robyn} and \ref{fig:marcel} highlight the unique environmental and regulatory conditions specific to this region, indicating a need for tailored sustainability strategies. It is important to acknowledge that this analysis also illustrates that further work would be required to describe other regions or specific vineyards. 

The primary difference in interactions between the two BNs (see Figure~\ref{fig:robyn} and~\ref{fig:marcel}) lies in vineyard floor management and tractor passes. In one, greater tractor passes were used purposefully to manage the vineyard floor; the other managed vineyard floor as a consequence of tractor passes, leveraging opportunities when the tractor was used. This distinction highlights how operational decisions can vary based on regional practices and priorities. A point was also raised that scale can cause a further driving factor, where tractor passes may be greatly increased as an expense on larger plots of land. However, this issue as well as directly attributing measurable cause to granular specifics such as composting, soil depth and clay content cannot be fully addressed without site or paddock specific knowledge.

As a factor, water emerged as the most interconnected variable for both BNs, with edges connecting it to almost everything either directly or indirectly, illustrating its fundamental role in agriculture. The edges between different factors reveals that water is the most connected. Weather conditions also play a significant role, influencing water availability, quality and disease/pest pressures.Within both of the models, the most significant factors impacting environmental sustainability are water quality, pest and disease management, market pressures, agrochemical use, and climate/weather conditions. These factors were identified as having the highest sensitivity to environmental impact, indicating their crucial roles in the sustainability of the region.

The influence of factors on each other are described through the CPT values (see appendix) and allow for an in-depth analysis of how changes in key factors, under various environmental and regulatory scenarios, influence the overall environmental impact. For instance, the significant sensitivity that environmental impact had with regard to pests/disease, climate and agrochemicals compared to factors such as green house gas emissions. Importantly that these sensitive factors also link greatly to one another, highlighting how critical areas for regulatory and environmental interventions can be to multiple factors beyond their specific target. Furthermore, the relationships help to illustrate the further complexity of how these significant factors relate to these further considerations such as greenhouse gas emissions and the extended connection to fuel or electricity use. Where addressing issues such as disease can require the increased use of tractors and thus fuel.

The Coonawarra-specific BN supports the findings from the literature, with a more structured map of how factors interact compared to the automatically generated figures from tools like Leximancer. The BN provides a detailed view of the relationships between factors, highlighting the central role of water and the interconnectedness of pest management, market pressures, and climate conditions. Additionally, the BNs emphasise economic factors, such as market pressures and grape prices, and includes how they interact within a scope of secondary factors like fuel and electricity use.

% The other case study BN aligns with the literature by visually representing connections and highlighting significant factors through bibliometric analysis. However, the BN derived from the industry panel offers explicit connections and sensitivity analyses based on expert knowledge, providing a more nuanced understanding of the factors and their impacts compared to the broader mind maps generated from literature reviews.

The two case study BNs are almost identical in their significant factors and interactions. Both emphasize the importance of water quality, pest and disease management, and climate conditions. The primary difference is the sensitivity to tractor passes, water quality, water scarcity, and soil degradation management, with one model showing higher sensitivity to these factors. Aside from the role of tractor passes, there are no major differences between the two BNs. The similarity in significant factors and their interactions underscores the robustness of the BN approach in capturing the critical elements of environmental sustainability in winegrowing.

The findings from the case study align closely with the literature, illustrating more directly how factors that contribute to environmental sustaianbility are connected. The BNs provide a detailed and structured view of primary factors and their relationships to secondary and tertiary concerns within the industry. This detailed evaluation helps prioritise actions and policies that could lead to significant improvements in the sustainability practices of winegrowing regions.

\section{Discussion}

This investigation highlights the key factors of Australian winegrowing that contribute to  environmental sustainability through the lens of BNs created with assistance from industry input. These models have established the intricate, and interconnected nature of various influences on environmental sustainability in Australian winegrowing. A keener understanding of how these factors both interact and effect one another from the perspective of research and industry is illustrated within these models, with a major outcome being the highlighting of water use's critical importance as one of the most interconnected variables. The influence of water use reached almost every variable, with its connection to operational decisions being reflected within its propagation to other factors such as tractor use, disease and pest prevention, as well as management strategies for soil. This finding aligns with water being the lifeblood of agriculture~\cite{chawlaWaterProductivityAgriculture2023}, essential for both the health of the vines and the broader ecosystem, especially within Australia's dry climate~\cite{australianbureauofstatisticsWaterUseAustralian2021}.

Of further significance was the management of pests and diseases, market pressures and climate. With these external influences being prominently connected to vineyard operations through their connection to factors such as fuel, tractor, water and electricity use. In particular, climate acted as an interface between water and pest/disease, due to climate being a determining factor in temperature and water availability which are highly influential to pests and disease~\cite{boisClimateVsGrapevine2017}. Of great concern to climate was how it influenced water availability, pest/disease pressures, and its overall contribution to vineyard health. Understanding these interactions is vital for developing adaptive management strategies that can cope with climate variability and change~\cite{agostaRegionalClimateVariability2012,alsafadiFutureScenariosBioclimatic2023,barriguinhaVineyardYieldEstimation2021,sharmaChapterImpactClimate2014}. In a more general sense climate and weather conditions are shown within the literature to be significant determinants of a variety of factors within vineyards such as yield~\cite{barriguinhaVineyardYieldEstimation2021,antonComparativeStudyRisk2012}, erosion~\cite{biddoccuEvaluationSoilErosion2020,doi:10.1177/0309133319861833}, and are further determinants of chosen grape varieties~\cite{topferGrapeVarietiesAre2022, petriashviliImpactClimateChange2023}. The BN models captured the complexity of how climate can propagate to these considerations through other factors; as well as how these other factors are connected.

The case study highlighted the direct influences on environmental sustainability, where environmental sustainability was found to be most sensitive to factors such as pests/disease, water use, economic pressures and climate which were found to be highly related through their connection to elements used in operational responses such as the use of agrochemicals and tractors (see Figures~\ref{fig:robyn} and~\ref{fig:marcel}). A major concern from the industry panel within these relationships was that, while necessary for maintaining vine health and productivity, excessive or inappropriate agrochemical use can lead to major negative environmental impacts~\cite{alonsogonzalezUnveilingTerroirEvaluating2024,manjarres-lopezAssessmentPesticideResidues2021}. The model emphasised the need for balanced and regulated agrochemical practices; and especially for such practices being followed appropriately~\cite{baianoOverviewSustainabilityWine2021}.

The findings from this study are consistent with the existing literature on sustainability in viticulture, which also identifies water management, pest/disease control, economic pressures, and climate conditions as key factors. Many of these singular relationships are well-defined within literature studies such as those between climate and pest/disease \cite{olatinwoChapterWeatherbasedPest2014}. Furthermore, literature  highlights a growing need for data and more decision support tools to assist with combatting external pressures such climate, water scarciy and disease \cite{naigeonDATADecisionmakingViticulture2023,stefaniniBayesianCausalModel2022,fincoCombiningPrecisionViticulture2022a,laurentLocalInfluenceClimate2022}. Tools such as Bayesian networks are becoming more applied to assist with the creation of decision support tools such as with water management \cite{carmonaUseParticipatoryObjectOriented2011} or vineyard placement \cite{abbalDecisionSupportSystem2016}. However, the combination of holistic approaches to reviewing sustainable practices in the adoption of techniques through measurable and holistic approaches is a growing need in policy creation and uptake of new novel sustainable practices \autocite{mayfieldDesigningExpertledBayesian2023,baianoOverviewSustainabilityWine2021,dichiaraCollaborativeApproachAchieving2024}. Although more holistic approaches are required to review the total accumulated benefits of sustainable practices, it is well aligned between researchers, the public and policy-makers that this endeavour is of great importance to the Australian agricultural industry as a whole \cite{dumbrellComparingAustralianPublic2024}.

The BN models provide structure to the broader way of how the major factors within literature interact, offering a clearer understanding of their interdependencies and relative sensitivity with regard to environmental sustainability as an outcome. The existing literature provides exceptional detailed understanding of many mechanisms behind the relationships explored within this study. The BN allows the further exploration of the peripheral connections beyond these relationships to be further considered. A strength behind the use of Bayesian Network is the ability to replace edges between nodes with any analysis that allows for the derivation of a posterior from some input prior; allowing for the BN to be used as a framework that can further integrate other studies results into these relationships~\cite{kimphuctranMachineLearningProbabilistic2022,kollerObjectOrientedBayesianNetworks1997,korbBayesianArtificialIntelligence2011}.

By linking fuel and electricity use with well-studied factors like water and climate, the BN model broadens the scope of sustainability research in viticulture, emphasising the interconnected nature of these challenges. Integrating elements which play critical roles in vineyard operational decisions such as tractor, fuel and electricity use, which were more peripheral within the bibliometric analysis, to central themes like water, pests/disease and climate offered a holistic view of sustainability in winegrowing. The model demonstrated how fuel, tractor, and electricity use are intertwined with factors such as water and climate through propagation. Even though environmental sustainability was not highly sensitive to such factors, they directly relate to operational decisions that can be influenced by growers over a season. For example, electricity and fuel use are crucial for irrigation systems, as well as fuel use and tractors required for operations linked to soil preparation, management, and pest/disease control actions. Notably these operational decisions can be preventative or reactionary within a season. With many of these decisions being directly influenced by the central themes described in the bibliometric analysis (soil, water and disease) particularly all of which are connected to climate~\cite{fragaClimateChangeNew2020,tofaloClimateChangeWine2023,naigeonDATADecisionmakingViticulture2023}. Additionally, the need to adapt to changing climate conditions can drive increased use of fuel and electricity, potentially exacerbating greenhouse gas emissions. The findings align with literature, with researchers highlighting how different operations contribute to climate change through greenhouse gas emmissions \cite{pilafidisAssessingEnergyUse2023,cechPesticideUseAssociated2022,zhangEstimatingEconomicEnvironmental2019} and conversely how climate change increases pressure on farmers~\cite{barnaEditorialImprovingSustainability2023,costaRoleSoilTemperature2023,atakClimateChangeAdaptive2024}, suggesting future research should focus on integrated resource management, technological innovations to reduce energy consumption, and policy incentives to promote energy-efficient practice~\cite{pereiraViticultureClimateChange2023}. This integrated perspective is crucial for developing effective strategies to enhance the sustainability of the winegrowing industry.

The integration of expert knowledge was an essential part of constructing these BNs, particularly in defining the structure of the network and the CPTs. However, even within this analysis, disagreements were present amongst the panel especially as the models became more granular. The model is limited by the knowledge of the expert panel and by its specificity to the Australian, and further the Coonawarra context. The model created is also limited, in that, it solely represents the outcomes of a single season in isolation. No further accounting for past or future factors that may affect vineyard outcomes or decisions were considered. A dynamic Bayesian network could potentially address this issue but would require further investigations regarding the temporal factors that occur between seasons. Although this is a limiting factor, the model created within this study could still operate as the central static consideration between these temporal factors if future research was conducted. Similarly, spatial influences are also difficult to generalise to. Factors influencing sustainability in one winegrowing region may differ significantly from those in another region due to variations in climate, soil types, management practices, and economic conditions. Therefore, the applicability of the BN developed for the Coonawarra region does not extend seamlessly to other wine regions. The more general model for Australia would also need to be altered to generalise to other countries due to the wide and varying circumstances that exist from country to country.

The BN models helped to illustrate how economic incentives can be drivers of sustainable practices. The definitive influence and relationships between what are more tertiary considerations of environmental sustainability being directly connected to further considerations such as operational costs. Market pressures, including the demand for high-quality grapes through factors such as grape prices, were found to have an impact on sustainability practices but were limited in this study through only reviewing them within the lens of environmental sustainability. The ability to effectively gauge whether operations could afford to engage further with management programs for factors such as soil, pests, disease etc was in part driven by the economic climate provided to growers as well as what may be much more specific circumstance; of which is a potential further avenue of research that would compliment this work significantly.

\section{Conclusion}

This study provides an in-depth examination of environmental sustainability in Australia and the Coonawarra winegrowing region using BNs. Through integrating industry expertise and empirical data, the BN models developed in this research offered a structured and quantitative framework for understanding the complex interactions amongst key factors influencing environmental sustainability. The findings highlight the critical role of water quality and availability, emphasising its critical influence on all operational decisions either directly or propagating through other factors. With this critical nature being due to water being the most interconnected factor. With this high interrelatedness emphasising the importance efficient water management practices enhancing sustainability in viticulture.

Pest and disease management emerged as another significant factor, with effective control strategies having the potential to mitigate excessive agrochemical use and its associated environmental impacts. The study also identified the substantial impact of market pressures and economic factors on sustainability practices, illustrating how economic incentives can drive or hinder sustainable vineyard management. Of significant relation both in the literature and the BN was climate's influence on all of these factors as well as overall vineyard health. The BN models captured the intricate ways these factors interact, highlighting the need for adaptive management strategies to cope with climate variability and change. With these factors all being connected in someway within the model through propagation across the BN.

The comparative analysis with existing literature affirmed the relationships explored by the expert panel adding robustness of the study's findings. With the BN itself, aligning well with previously identified key factors while providing a more detailed map of their interdependencies. The BN approach not only confirmed known relationships but also illustrated how these relationships looked holistically across sustainability within the winegrowing industry.

Overall a comprehensive analysis of key factors and their interactions within the Australian winegrowing industry was gained. The use of BN models for further regions could help to inform more specific targeted interventions and policy-making, aiding in the promoting of sustainable practices in the winegrowing industry. The integration of expert knowledge and empirical data in this research demonstrates the potential of BNs as powerful decision support tools for sustainability analysis and decision-making in agriculture. With the potential to enhance this research being the further incorporation of time, other regional specific considerations and economic outcomes related to these environmental concerns.
