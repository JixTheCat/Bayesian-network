abstract = {To control manufacturing processes, integration of flows of manufacturing information is an important starting point. In this regard, an effective Integrated Manufacturing Information System (IMIS) which is capable of monitoring, analyzing, and inspecting manufacturing processes properly is critical. Often, most of difficulties in achieving an effective IMIS stem from a poor design for the system architecture. This study particularly addresses the problem of coupling in architecture of an IMIS and its effect on the system performance. This study employs “Independence Axiom” of the Axiomatic Design (AD) theory to deal with the problem and uses “times in process” and “utilized capacities of available resources” as two important criteria for evaluating the system performance. To verify the proposed methodology, a real IMIS is addressed, its stochastic behavior is simulated in Visual SLAM and AweSim (version 3.o) software environment, and the outcomes are analyzed by using logistic regression method for each level of system decomposition. Results of the analyses indicate that fulfillment of independence axiom of AD theory can significantly enhance performance of the concerned IMIS.}

abstract = {This article intends to identify and construct a Wesleyan perspective of business and entrepreneurship, drawing on how Wesley viewed and used business and entrepreneurship in relation to poverty in England, in order to identify helpful implications for the church which seeks to engage with poverty-related issues. Wesley did not repudiate or underestimate business and entrepreneurship in believers’ lives; rather, he provided believers with practical guidance and theological foundations for business and entrepreneurship particularly in the context of poverty. We argue that Wesley should be viewed as a compassionate entrepreneur—with the compassion of a liberator and the practice of an entrepreneur, as he encouraged believers to actively participate in economic activities, and recognized entrepreneurship as a sustainable and significant way to empower the poor. Wesley’s example challenges the church today as his case study serves as a radical and faithful application of biblical economic teachings on business and entrepreneurship.}

abstract = {The practice-based view has recently been proposed as a counter to the resource-based view of the firm. Unlike the resource-based view, the practice-based view contends that performance differences among firms can accrue from readily available practices. Using a large sample of wines over a 20-year period, I find evidence of a significant relationship between the implementation of practices and performance. Findings also indicate that the strength of this relationship is contingent on the possession of valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable resources (a firm-level moderator) and the prevalence of practices (an industry-level moderator). The impact of practices on performance is less pronounced when firms possess valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable resources. It also declines as they become more widespread in an industry.}

abstract = {Counterurbanisation is transforming rural communities and has implications for entrepreneurial opportunities in rural areas. The rural economy has seen a shift away from the dominant productivist paradigm towards an increasingly consumption-led array of businesses, facilitated by increased mobility and connectivity. Part of this transition has seen increasing rates of new businesses started by people moving into rural areas. This ‘commercial counterurbanisation’, is stimulating local economies but the ensuing nature of ‘development’ demands deeper investigation. In particular, this paper explores the ways in which entrepreneurs moving into rural areas are able to recognise distinctive opportunities and assets associated with rurality, drawing on a combination of their extra-local connections and access to local forms of capital. We conclude that the spatiality of social capital and the degree to which commercial counterurbanites become locally embedded are key factors in determining the characteristics of the businesses that they develop.}

abstract = {As agritourism has been gaining in popularity as a form of special interest tourism, researchers have investigated different aspects of this phenomenon. However, academic literature seems to be mostly atheoretical thus far. Considering the highly experiential nature of agritourism activities, the current study tested the potential power of experiential consumption dimensions on explaining visitor flow experience, satisfaction with, and loyalty toward an agritourism attraction located on a wine farm in South Africa. A large data set collected with an onsite survey was analyzed. The study reveals several theoretical findings and extends the literature on the experiential dimensions of agritourism/wine tourism/farm tourism, as well as providing practical implications that may aid operators of such attractions to make more informed decisions with regard to their tourism product and budget allocation.}
