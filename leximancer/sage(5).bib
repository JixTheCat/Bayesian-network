abstract = {The right to own and derive value out of the land, (cf. ownership) is a human right enshrined in the constitution of most democratic countries. Land reform is arguably the most emotional, socio-economic, and political subject of the colonial and post-colonial era of the African continent. It is a subject that has remained sacred and a taboo creating a fertile ground for protracted political, social, economic, and religious conflicts. Many African indigenous communities are genuinely struggling to address inequality and deprivation. Despite the overwhelming economic demand to address the land question, only a handful of African countries have been bold enough to tackle the issue head-on, sometimes with dire consequences. In the current article, we use the Zimbabwe land reform programme as a case and through a biblical lens show cause for land not just as a commodity where belonging is the ultimate deciding factor but rather emphasise ownership by stewardship. This perspective is compatible with modern systems of governance, ubuntu in the African traditional culture, and encourage efficiency of production to achieve food security despite the polarised discourse of land reform in most countries.}

abstract = {In days gone by, Balaton Lake predominately attracted domestic tourists, without focusing on the countries which neighbour Hungary and their respective markets. However, as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, domestic and regional tourism flows have been stimulated, as travel restrictions resulted in a tendency towards travel to local and neighbouring destinations. In line with these trends, the research investigates the congruence of both Balaton Lake’s projected and perceived (virtual) destination image in the era of Covid-19, with Serbia being considered as a neighbouring and emitting market. The study deployed a sequential exploratory mixed-method approach (qualitative and then quantitative). The study contributes to the existing knowledge by addressing the gap between the visual and textual content of a projected (virtual) destination image and by acknowledging non-visitor perception of destination image in the context of pronounced regional international travel.}

abstract = {Gastro-tourists specifically travel to learn about new cultures through memorable food experiences. They span all ages, ethnicities, and incomes. These tourists plan more trips, stay longer, and spend more discretionary money when they travel. Interactions that include learning about regional foods and kitchen cultures and that foster relationships between the gastro-tourist and the gastro-host are more important to them than fancy amenities. Research that identifies characteristics and attributes of gastro-tourism experiences considered memorable is sparse. This inductive qualitative research study triangulated three data sources and two data collection methods (in-depth interviews and online surveys). Seven attributes linked to memorability are identified: (1) deliberate and incidental gastro-tourists, (2) travel stages, (3) foodie risk-taking, (4) interdependent co-created tourist–host relationships, (5) authenticity, (6) sociability, and (7) emotions. The attributes provide insights into the prevalent shift from product/service-dominant tourism to co-created experiential tourism opportunities and highlight the motivations that drive this emerging gastro-tourism market segment. By uncovering triggering moments that gastro-tourists value and find memorable, this study adds to the knowledge base of sustainable tourism development, destination branding promises, co-creation, and stakeholder theories.}

abstract = {Indigenous people are considering how to safeguard their natural resources, culture and knowledge against illegal, inappropriate or unauthorised use. Such protection is needed to maintain the integrity of Indigenous relationship to and control over such resources, while allowing for potential benefits from such resources to support tribal social and economic development. Using the case study of taramea (Aciphylla aurea), a sub-alpine speargrass, traditionally used to make fragrance by Ngāi Tahu (a large tribe from the South Island, New Zealand), we assess potential approaches to protection, ranging from national and international intellectual property approaches such as trademarking, copyright and patenting to extra-legal approaches such as supply chain auditing, blockchain, biocultural trademarks and biocultural labels. From this assessment, we evaluate approaches’ usefulness against a range of Indigenous and market-oriented attributes. We find that while each approach has advantages and disadvantages, no one method is superior, so we recommend a mix of approaches.}

abstract = {This article addresses the legitimation of taste in cultural fields by examining the role of generational dynamics in the field of fine wine. In the last decade, ‘natural’ wine has become an increasingly influential category in the fine wine field. The article explores how legitimating media institutions in this field represent natural wine, particularly as regards to the symbolic properties of cultural taste. The empirical material consists of articles published in two leading US wine magazines, VinePair and Wine Spectator. The analysis shows that natural wine was represented as a contested category whose aesthetic qualities were only partially legitimated. Moreover, generational and age-coded categories were deployed to construct oppositions between natural wines and other fine wines, as well as between their respective proponents. The aesthetic characteristics of natural wine were associated with emerging forms of cultural capital that partly challenged established aesthetic standards in the fine wine field connected to traditional highbrow cultural capital. Contestations over natural wine are therefore indicative of symbolic struggles over cultural taste in the fine wine field. In conclusion, the article contributes to research in cultural fields by analysing the relationship between generational classifications and contestations over aesthetic standards in the legitimation of taste.}

abstract = {In the first half of the 2000s, one project to restore the former Danube floodplain was carried out in Belene, a marginal town on the Bulgarian Danube. The aim of this article is to record the practices that were already in place before the interventions on the Danube, as part of a heterogeneous local knowledge that had an alternative vision to the scientific knowledge of experts involved in the restoration project. The data comes from qualitative interviews with locals and experts implicated in this project, as well as ethnographic observations from the fieldwork I carried out in 2013–2014, 2020 and 2022. The conclusion is that without attempting to replace the scientific knowledge, the locals aim to impose, through their local knowledge, a sort of slow ecology that eases the pace of the restoration of the former Danube floodplains.}

abstract = {The 21st century rise of culturally omnivorous tastes and classifications proffers a new dilemma for how markets create attachments and achieve trust for global consumers. Consumer entities must be both globally circulatable and offer a sense of localized authenticity without compromising either. Drawing from research on market trust and attachment, this article introduces the concept of mobile trust regimes to account for how sets of actors and repertoires attempt to address this tension. Through two case studies from gastronomic industries—food halls and natural wine—we investigate the devices of mobility used to facilitate the global circulation of the local. These include standardized aesthetic and affective templates communicated through physical décor, recurrent narratives, and social media curation. We argue that the concept of mobile trust regimes helps clarify two key issues in contemporary consumer culture: tensions between homogenization and heterogenization and how the symbolic value of omnivorous tastes becomes institutionalized and even banal.}
