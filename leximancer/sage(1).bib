abstract = {Current infrared spectroscopy applications in the field of viticulture are moving toward direct in-field measuring techniques. However, limited research is available on quantitative applications using direct measurement of fresh tissue. The few studies conducted have combined the spectral data from various cultivars, growing regions, grapevine organs, and phenological stages during model development. The spectral data from these heterogeneous samples are combined into a single data set and analyzed jointly during quantitative analysis. Combining the spectral information of these diverse samples into a global data set could be an unsuitable approach and could yield less accurate prediction results. Spectral differences among samples could be overlooked during model development and quantitative analysis. The development of specialized calibrations should be considered and could lead to more accurate quantitative analyses. This study explored a model optimization strategy attempting global and specialized calibrations. Global calibrations, containing data from multiple organs, berry phenological, and shoot lignification stages, were compared to specialized calibrations per organ or stage. The global calibration for organs contained data from shoots, leaves, and berries and produced moderately accurate prediction results for nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen. The specialized calibrations per organ yielded more accurate calibrations with a coefficient of determination in validation (R2val) at 90.65% and a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) at 0.32% dry matter (DM) for the berries’ carbon calibrations. The leaves and shoots carbon calibrations had R2val and RMSEP at 84.99%, 0.34% DM, and 90.06%, 0.37% DM, respectively. The specialized calibrations for nitrogen and hydrogen showed similar improvements in prediction accuracy per organ. Specialized calibrations per phenological and lignification stage were also explored. Not all stages showed improvement, however, most stages had comparable or improved results for the specialized calibrations compared to the global calibrations containing all phenological or lignification stages. The results indicated that both global and specialized calibrations should be considered during model development to optimize prediction accuracy.}

abstract = {In the face of rising sustainability issues, increasing numbers of organisations are trying to build compromises between their economic purpose and ecological objectives. Organisational studies focus on the analysis of such compromise processes but most studies do not seek to grasp the substantial changes advocated by ecological critiques. Our research is aimed at addressing that gap by clarifying the radical view sustained by ecological imaginary beyond conventional compromise processes. We engage in a qualitative study of biodynamics – an agricultural method based on a radical ecological imaginary – to evaluate its moral underpinnings through Boltanski and Thévenot’s Economies of Worth framework. Our findings help us to grasp the radical moral substance of ecological critique and to extend that framework beyond its dualist assumption. By highlighting antagonisms between meta-conceptions of justice rather than analysing compromises, our research provides insights into the radical organisational changes advocated by ecological critiques.}

Turning attention to the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and their multiple uses and abuses of organic farming, this article explores epistemic and political spatial operations on the colonial frontier. Applying a relational conceptualization of three spatial modalities—soil, territory, and land—we explore the ways in which these modalities serve as political apparatuses: Soil designates the romantic perception of cultivable space, territory is concerned with borders and political sovereignty, and land is seen as a space of economic value and as a means of production. While agriculture is a well-known instrument of expansion and dispossession, organic farming contributes to the colonial operation by binding together affective attachment to the place, and new economic singularity in relation to environmental and ethical claims. We argue that organic farming practices converge claims for local authenticity, spatial appropriation, and high economic values that are embedded in what we term the colonial quality turn. Ultimately, organic farming in the West Bank normalizes the inherent violence of the colonial project and strengthens the settlers’ claim for political privilege.}

abstract = {Cover crops are a valuable tool for improving resources use, soil health, and productivity. However, the effects of intercropping cover crops as live mulches with cash crops can vary depending on the species, management practices, and environmental conditions. This study reviewed the literature on cover crop intercropping and identified key factors to consider for improved plant productivity and resources use when managing these cropping systems. Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar were used to search for literature on managing cover crop intercropping as live mulches. Research has shown that annual cover crops are typically used in annual field crop systems, while perennial cover crops are typically used in orchards and vineyards. The effects of intercropping annual or perennial cover crops in vineyards, orchards, and field crop systems can vary from positive to negative, depending on the climate, soil, management, and production system. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all management strategy. However, there are some key factors that should be considered when managing cover crops, such as: compatibility, intercropping time, planting density, and termination time. The benefits of appropriate cover crop management include: extended growing season, increased soil fertility, resource use optimization, and increased biomass productivity. Cover crop intercropping can be a successful way to improve resource use, soil health and productivity, but it is important to carefully consider the specific crop and management practices to ensure success. Therefore, future research should optimize cover crop intercropping time and planting density in maize-based rainwater harvesting systems on productivity and resource use.}

This approach focuses on the vertical governance dynamics of environmental upgrading along with GVCs. In our contribution, we emphasize the role of horizontal governance as a driver that underpins environmental upgrading processes. These horizontal elements include institutional support, pressure from civil society groups and political dynamics at the local level – which have been relatively overlooked in this literature so far. We examine environmental upgrading in Italian wine value chains, focusing on the fast-growing but environmentally-contested Prosecco and Valpolicella districts. Our analysis suggests that firms within the same industry may follow different processes of environmental upgrading – through certification, going ‘back to tradition’, technological innovation and/or as an articulation of local politics – also depending on their size. We conclude that horizontal governance is playing a more important role than previously thought in shaping environmental upgrading and provide some suggestions for future research in this realm.}

abstract = {The sustainability transformation of the food system involves imagining a sustainable future whilst functioning within the current unsustainable food system. Some argue there is a difference between the goal-oriented and comfort seeking form in which the near future is engaged, and the reflexive, imaginary way in which the distant future is engaged. This begs the question, how is engagement with near and distant futures balanced, and what does this mean for the overall sustainability transformation of the food system? We studied future engagement in practices of food entrepreneurship in the Dutch province of Flevoland during the disruption caused by the covid-19-induced lockdowns. This disruption posed a challenge and an opportunity to study near and distant future engagement in depth. Through an online survey and offline semi-structured interviewing, we questioned practitioners of sustainable food entrepreneurship during the first and second lockdown, respectively. The findings show near future engagement is mostly associated with immediate change in practices enforced by the covid-19 lockdown, whereas distant future engagement primarily was visible in continuous change in practices as associated with sustainability. However, this does not mean near and distant future were perfectly balanced. Therefore, we argue pre-existing trends with regards to sustainability can be accelerated or obstructed when they meet the immediate effects of disruption. Our paper concludes by stating the need for more research to the interaction of near and distant futures in different contexts and circumstances.}

abstract = {This article examines the representation of sustainability on the online lifestyle site Goop as a case study of how promotional media deal with environmental and social concerns. Specifically, the paper presents how promotional intermediaries address or conceal a tension between (1) the promotion of conspicuous consumption and (2) the advocacy of sustainable living. The paper contributes to cultural intermediary scholarship by showing how promotional intermediaries attempt to reconcile this tension, advocating consumerism favorable to them while still enhancing critical cultural citizenship. By presenting sustainable brands and environmental advocates, and different—at times, incommensurable—narratives on the relationship between sustainability and consumption, promotional intermediaries signal that sustainability is important while promoting actions that can be considered to contradict the idea of sustainability, such as excessive consumption. In this way they produce a safe space for brands and consumers but arrive at a sustainability paradox.}
