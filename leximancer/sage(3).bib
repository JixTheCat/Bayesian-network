abstract = {In recent years, the need for profound changes in agricultural practices has become increasingly acknowledged, and it has given rise to an intense, and rapidly intensifying, debate among experts and in the media. Before the general framework under which this debate currently unfolds become too set in stone, it would seem useful to devote some time to a reflexion on how discussions should be approached in order to have the best chance to result in practically workable, sustainable solutions. In a recent, provocative article, Amundson (2022) voiced very strong opinions in this respect. In particular, he criticizes the emergence in the general public of “we” visions about alternate forms of agriculture, he argues that key current stakeholders (i.e. farmers) imperatively have to be included in the discussions, and he opines that the debate should not attempt to solve “social wicked problems”, which tend to remain long-standing because no one can manage to solve them. In the present article, I propose an in-depth reflexion on these three aspects of the debate, and adopt very different perspectives than Amundson’s (2022). After decades of laboriously trying to get members of the general public engaged with soils and agricultural issues, “we” visions with which members of the public may come up need to be resolutely welcomed, carefully analyzed, and responded to, soon after they emerge. Furthermore, I argue that stakeholders who are currently in the agricultural sector may not necessarily be the most likely to eventually implement changes and therefore should not be allowed to sway the debate in a direction that suits them in the short run. Finally, I contend that the lack of willingness, or the reluctance, of decision-makers and the private sector to envisage fundamental changes, thereby giving the impression that some problems cannot be readily solved, should not constrain in any way the scope of the reflexion.}

We focus on how controversial innovations gain acceptance as the result of the intentional strategies put into place by companies. We’ve carried a qualitative research based on secondary data collected from several online sources. Our study describes how a new packaging, can, had been introduced to the highly conservative market of wine in France. Our findings shed light on the opportunity for practitioners to implement controversial innovation in conservative markets and introduce a set of strategies to achieve such purpose.}

abstract = {Long‐term vision depends on history, and on history alone. Scholarship in technology, manufacturing, and operations management is incomplete without a knowledge of history. In chronicling the history of technology, knowledge, and manufacturing, we have traced the remarkable continuity in the evolution of humans from hominins to homo sapiens, in the migration of homo sapiens from Africa to the furthest reaches of the world, and in the rise of civilizations and industrialization driven by agriculture surplus. Technology, knowledge, and manufacturing did not and do not exist in isolation and many disciplines have addressed them in the literature. Here, we concern ourselves with human history until 1760, roughly when the Industrial Revolution began. Our companion paper, Singhal and Singhal (2022; Technology and manufacturing‐and‐service operations 1760–1945. Production and Operations Management, this issue), explores the history of technology and manufacturing‐and‐service operations since the Industrial Revolution.}

abstract = {The increasing interest in the protection of the agricultural landscape as a category of heritage can be observed both in the growing number of globally recognized agricultural landscapes and in the development of new legal and institutional tools for their protection. The multifunctionality of agriculture, involving the multiplicity of interests and actors, engenders the questions of how and who manages the heritage agricultural landscapes at the local level? The research aims to provide an empirical model for the identification and evaluation of the local governance models used in the management of multifunctional agricultural landscapes. It focuses on two heritage agricultural landscapes in Italy and bases on field observations, semi-structured in-depth interviews with the local stakeholders and comparative analysis of the case studies. The research draws the map of interaction between the local stakeholders. It outlines the crucial role played by the local governing bodies in the management of heritage agricultural landscapes, involving several administrative and sociocultural units.}

abstract = {As new roles emerge in organizations, it becomes critical to understand how organizational structure can impede or enable the managerial discretion available to role incumbents. We leverage the rich context provided by the emergent role of sustainability managers to examine the interplay between the top-down forces of structure and the bottom-up influences of managerial discretion in shaping new organizational roles over time. We analyzed qualitative data collected from in-depth interviews with sustainability managers in 21 case study organizations in India and Australia, supplemented with archival and observational data. We identified three organizational configurations, with varying levels of top-down structural and bottom-up managerial discretion dynamics at play. Each configuration had different implications for the manager’s role. Our analysis suggests that the third configuration—with semi-structured formalization and a decentralized sustainability program—provided the most conducive conditions for managers to use their discretion to champion innovative sustainability initiatives. New managerial roles in the other configurations, however, do not have to be static. With the maturation of organizational programs and active championing by managers, the structuring of organizational functions and managerial roles can co-evolve. Our findings describe a process of “shaping and being shaped,” as structure and managerial discretion co-evolve over time.}

The important environmental movements interlinked with mining issues are discussed such as the Kalinganagar movement, the anti-POSCO movement, Kashipur (UAIL) movement, the Niyamgiri movement, and the BALCO movement of Odisha.}
