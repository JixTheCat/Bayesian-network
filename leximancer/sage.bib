abstract = {Although transit buses have a relatively small impact on greenhouse gas emissions, they have a larger impact on urban air quality, have commercially available electric models, and have historically commercialized clean technologies that enabled deployment in other heavy-duty vehicles. This paper investigates what factors affect transit agencies’ decisions to go beyond electric bus pilots to larger scale deployments, with the goal of identifying strategies to enable an accelerated transition to an electrified fleet. This mixed methods analysis utilized quantitative total cost of ownership analysis and qualitative interviews to study the barriers and drivers of electric bus investment for transit fleets in three case study states: California, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. A total cost of ownership analysis estimated electric buses are already more cost-effective than diesel buses in many agency contexts, but are sensitive to key parameters such as annual mileage, fossil fuel costs, and electricity tariffs and supporting policies that vary widely. Though multiple agencies in California reported planning to fully electrify their fleets, outside California where less supportive policies exist, fewer agencies reported planning to procure additional electric buses, primarily owing to high first cost and undesirable tradeoffs with maintaining transit service levels. Interview respondents also reported other substantial barriers such as oversubscribed grant programs, charging infrastructure costs, electricity costs, and additional operational complexity, suggesting a need for multiple complementary policies to overcome these barriers and ensure agencies can transition to a new technology without affecting transit service.}

abstract = {Soil and water loss in agricultural fields is a global problem. Although studies about soil erosion in croplands and vineyards exist, the direct comparison between these land uses is missing, especially under continental climates in Europe. Therefore, it is needed to find control measures to the impacts of these land-use management strategies on soil properties and hydrological response. The objective of this work is to estimate and compare the impacts of croplands and vineyards under conventional management croplands and vineyards on soil properties (water holding capacity—WHC; bulk density—BD; soil water content—SWC; water stable aggregates—WSA; mean weight diameter—MWD; soil organic matter—SOM; available phosphorus—AP; total nitrogen—TN) and hydrological response (runoff—Run; sediment content—SC; sediment loss—SL; carbon loss—C loss; phosphorus loss—P loss; nitrogen loss—N loss) in Eastern Croatia. To achieve these goals, a study was set up using rainfall simulation tests at 58 mm h−1 over 30 minutes on 2 locations (Zmajevac: 45°48′N; 18°46′E; Erdut: 45°30′N; 19°01′E). In total, 32 rainfall simulations were carried out, 8 repetitions in vineyards and 8 in cropland plots of 0.876 m2, per location. Bulk density was significantly higher in cropland plots compared with the vineyard. Soil water content was significantly higher in Zmajevac cropland compared with Erdut plots. Also, SWC was significantly lower in Zmajevac vineyard than in the cropland located in the same area. Water stable aggregates and MWD were significantly higher in vineyard plots than in the cropland. Also, SOM and TN were significantly lower in Zmajevac cropland compared with the vineyard located in the same area. Available phosphorus was significantly high in Zmajevac plots than in Erdut. The rainfall simulations showed that Run was significantly higher in Erdut vineyard (8.2 L m−2) compared with Zmajevac (3.8 L m−2). Also, the Run in Erdut Cropland was significantly lower than in the vineyard. Sediment content did not show significant differences among locations. In Erdut, vineyard plots had a significantly lower SL (28.0 g m−2) than the cropland ones (39.1 g m−2). C loss was significantly higher in Zmajevac cropland than in Erdut. Also, C loss was significantly lower in Zmajevac vineyard compared with the cropland. We did not observe significant differences in P loss, and N loss also did not show significant differences. The principal component analysis showed that SOM was associated with WSA, AP, and TN. These variables were negatively related to slope, SWC, and C loss (factor 1). Also, MWD was inversely related to SL, P, and N loss (factor 2). Bulk density and SC were negatively related to Run. Overall, we conclude that noninvertive tillage practices in vineyards preserve soil structure, enhance soil quality, and reduce the extent of soil degradation.}

abstract = {Global warming (GW) refers to the gradual increase in Earth’s average surface temperature caused by human activities. This phenomenon has far-reaching consequences that affect the environment, society, and economy and has created a multitude of challenges for the wine industry, affecting grape cultivation, wine production, aging, and quality management. To analyze the negative impact of GW on the wine industry and to examine the equilibrium that maximizes welfare and profit in the face of climate change. A mathematical model that considers the various stages of wine production to examine the wine industry’s equilibrium that maximizes welfare and profit. Global warming impacts the wine industry’s equilibrium, causing measurable distortions and an inefficient market solution. However, our analysis also indicates that adaptation to GW is possible by adopting and adjusting new agricultural practices. Our findings suggest that GW has a notable negative impact on the wine industry. Winemakers should consider adapting their agricultural practices. In addition, policymakers need to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change on the wine industry. Policymakers should promote the adoption of renewable energy sources and sustainable farming practices in the wine industry and provide financial incentives and regulatory support to maximize welfare.}

abstract = {Soil erosion is widely acknowledged as a global problem but attempts to measure and estimate its significance are frustrated by our inability to develop reliable, cheap and easy methods of assessment. The limitations of qualitative methods such as GLASOD, errors and inaccuracies inherent in modelling based on small-scale plot experiments, and problems with 137Cs approaches, mean that alternative strategies are required. For runoff-related erosion on arable land we propose the use of a well-tried estimation technique: volumetric measurement of rills, gullies and fans. Amounts of wash and interrill erosion can also be estimated. This approach allows for the estimation of erosion rates at the field scale, rather than relying on extrapolations from plot-based data. Measurements are based on sampling the population of rills and gullies and can be adapted to the aims of the project for ‘broad-brush’ or detailed data. Monitoring of large areas to produce regional assessments of erosion risk is frequently required and volumetric estimates provide these data. Thus predictions of the extent, frequency and amounts of erosion can be made and the vulnerability of particular crops becomes clear.}

abstract = {The study of alternative soil managements to tillage, based on the evidence of climate change in the Mediterranean basin, is of great importance. Summer and autumn are critical seasons for soil degradation due to the high-intensity, short-duration storms. Vineyards are vulnerable, especially on steep slopes. The particular effects of storms over the years under different soil conditions due to different management practices are not frequently addressed in the literature. The aim of this study was to examine the differences between runoff and soil moisture patterns influenced by 2 treatments: traditional tillage (Till) and a permanent cover crop. A shallow-rooted grass species Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. with considerable density coverage was selected as cover crop. This annual species was seeded once in the first year and then allowed to self-seed the following years. Tillage was performed at least twice in spring to a 10- to 15-cm depth and once in late autumn at a depth of 20 to 35 cm. Rainfall simulation experiments were performed, 1 year after treatments, using high-intensity rainfall on closed plots of 2 m2, located in the middle strips of the vineyard with different treatments. The effects of simulated rainfall experiments were determined in 3 different moments of the growth cycle of cultivar: (1) in summer with dry soils, (2) in early autumn with moderate soil moisture, and (3) in autumn with wet soils. During the 2-year trial, the soil moisture level in the soil upper layer (0-10 cm) was higher for Till treatment (14.1% ± 2.4%) compared with that for cover crop treatment (12.3% ± 2.0%). However, soil moisture values were more similar between treatments at 35 cm depth (12% ± 1%), with the exception of spring and autumn; in spring, water consumption in the cover crop treatment was the highest, and the moisture level at 35 cm depth was reduced (12%) compared with that for Till treatment (13%). In autumn, in cover crop treatment, higher water infiltration rate in soils led to higher soil moisture content at 35 cm (11%) compared with that of Till treatment (10%). The effects of simulated rainfall experiments on runoff and infiltration under different soil conditions and management practices vary seasonally. Runoff was significantly higher in summer for cover crop treatment (11%) as compared with that for Till management (1%), but significantly lower (3%) with wetter soils than for Till treatment (22%) in autumn. Thus, the simulation experiments with wet soils using cover crops produced higher infiltration rates and, consequently, the higher soil moisture content in the following days. The difference between seasons is attributed to the greater porosity of soil under Till treatment in summer, which resulted from the shallow plowing (10-15 cm depth), carried out to reduce moisture competition between weeds. The effect of traditional spring plowing was short-lived. The infiltration of water increased by cover crop treatment as compared with tillage in autumn both before and after ripping. Management practices did not influence wine parameters, as no significant differences were found between wine organoleptic characteristics in the duo-trio wine tastings, similarly, no differences were found for alcoholic degree, acidity, reduced sugars, and pH; however, a trend for a positive increase in polyphenol contents was noticed. Therefore, properly managed to avoid water shortages, cover crops can be recommended for soil protection in semi-arid environments.}

abstract = {Global food security is at risk due to the predicted climate change, making it imperative for agronomists to provide adaptive technologies that will sustain and improve food production. Rainfed agriculture, prone to drought, covers an estimated 80% of global cropland. One of the adaptive technologies is the use of antitranspirants – products that are applied on plants to reduce transpirational water loss and increase crop performance under drought conditions. The benefits of improving antitranspirant adoption in drought mitigation are expected to be high, especially in many drought-prone low-income countries where crop production is almost wholly dependent on rainfall. The objective of this article was to review the commercial uses of antitranspirants in food and non-food crop production. The review revealed that in horticulture, antitranspirants have several commercial uses, in addition to drought mitigation, such as transplanting shock amelioration, protection of fruit against sunburn, enhancement of nutritional quality, synchronising fruit ripening, protection of fruit and nut trees against diseases. Use of antitranspirants in arable farming has been neglected for three main reasons: first, arable crops have lower market value, for example, in Melbourne (Australia) in October 2022, a tonne of grapes was worth US$ 2694.82 compared to US$ 277/tonne of wheat. Second, molecular genetics applied to crop breeding has risen as an alternative approach to drought mitigation, shifting attention from antitranspirants. Finally, the erroneous research conclusion in the 1970s that antitranspirants could not increase yield because they reduced photosynthesis discouraged commercialisation of antitranspirants in arable farming. An antitranspirant breakthrough to either lower the cost or create a multi-purpose product is needed for the production of arable crops, especially major cereals, as has been the case for non-drought amelioration uses in horticulture.}

abstract = {New trends related to market incomes, cultural human development, non-sustainable soil management practices, and climate change are affecting land abandonment in Mediterranean sloping vineyards. It is generally accepted that hydrological processes and, subsequently, soil erosion rates are usually different between cultivated and abandoned soils. However, these alterations are still poorly studied in relation to the general weather conditions in vineyards and abandoned vineyards. Thus, the main goals of this research are to (1) estimate the differences in soil properties, (2) quantify water and soil losses due to rainfall and specific soil management practices, and (3) analyze which kind of weather type and rainfall event is able to generate specific surface flows and soil loss rates. To achieve these goals, we focused on the specific case of the sloping vineyards of the Montes de Málaga (South Spain). We used 4 paired-erosion plots with Gerlach troughs to quantify soil loss and surface flow and conducted an analysis of the weather conditions during each rainfall event. The weather types that generated the highest amount of rainfall in the studied area came from the western (32.6%) and southeast (28.2%) types. The low rainfall events came from the south type (5.9%) and at the 500 hPa level, whereas the rainiest ones came from the southwest (47.7%) and south (34.1%). It is confirmed that there is a bimodality in the rainfall patterns. The results of soil erosion showed that there is a mixed mechanism depending on the state of the soil (vegetation cover, compaction, and initial soil moisture), soil management (tillage, trampling effect, and the use of herbicides). It is observed that the intensity of surface flow is highly correlated to the total rainfall amount and intensity. In the poorly managed abandoned plot, it is important to remark that the effect of tillage in the past, the elimination of the vegetation cover to preserve the soil in bare condition, and its use as a grazing area by cultivating barley highly affects the generation of the highest erosive events. Therefore, it is confirmed that these soil management options are not the most sustainable way to conserve the soil after the abandonment of cultivation.}
