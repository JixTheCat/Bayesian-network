abstract = {Urban development and land release policies in the city fringes are criticised because they often fail to achieve their objectives such as providing affordable housing for low to moderate-income groups as well as provision of infrastructure and transportation. From a Marxian point of view, urban development plans fail because of the inherent contradictions of capital, and consequently, maximisation of surplus-value becomes the main objectives of land supply policies. In this paper, I draw on the Lacanian concept of drive and use the homology between Marxian surplus-value and Lacanian surplus-enjoyment to explain how the market rationality of neoliberalism (late-capitalism) deflects the desired objectives of urban development plans (UDPs); that is, the desire to provide affordable housing and urban services and infrastructure instead facilitates speculative activities on land in the suburban areas of a metropolis, such as Perth, Western Australia. In particular, the paper focuses on the neoliberal intuitional and financial dimensions of UDPs. In conclusion, I suggest how planners may deal with the pressure of the lack in the hegemonic discourse of neoliberalism in order to avoid the stuckness of the logic of drive materialised in the operation of planning institutions.}

abstract = {Airing for over 50 years, New Zealand’s Country Calendar (CC) television show tells the stories of those who live and work on the land. This article presents a thematic analysis of 25 years of programme content, identifying a balance of ‘connection’ and ‘progress’ themes across this time frame, linked to the political economy of NZ broadcasting and agriculture. The concept of the rural idyll helps explain the connection theme’s focus on family, community, a passion or dream, and history and tradition. However, CC’s version of the rural idyll goes beyond nostalgia and the expression of shared social ideals to include the practical, day-to-day ‘work’ of contemporary farming. Ultimately, CC’s content is shaped by the broadcasting and agricultural policies and structures which impact its funding, subjects and socio-economic environment.}

abstract = {We investigate how family and non-family small-and-medium size enterprises (SMEs) differ in their preference for patenting over secrecy as a means to protect value of intellectual property, and how proactive orientation moderates this relationship. Because secrecy carries more risks for spillover than patenting, we propose and provide evidence to suggest that family SMEs are more likely to use patents than secrecy relative to non-family SMEs as a mechanism to protect value. However, proactive orientation can weaken this relationship, since SMEs with a proactive orientation will avoid the disclosure of information required for patenting. Using a sample of 300 SMEs from four countries in the wine industry, we find support for our hypotheses and contribute to both the intellectual property (IP) and SME literatures by explaining how family SMEs relative to non-family SMEs protect the value of IP.}

abstract = {Wine tourism, traditionally understood as an activity practised by adults, has been suggested as a tourism form also adequate and interesting for families with children. However, both literature and practice do not consider this segment to the extent it, arguably, may deserve. Many challenges are associated with the creation of wine tourism offerings for children. Even so, wine estates and destinations attract families, not only for their wine-related attributes but also for their rural and cultural appeal. In Central Portugal, the Dão and Bairrada wine routes cover tourist regions strongly linked to family tourism. Nevertheless, there is a lack of wine tourism offerings targeting this segment. Likewise, there are no know studies on wineries’ managers perceptions of this market. Thus, this study aims to identify and analyse how wine estates and wineries from these wine routes cater to families with children, to understand the managers’ perception of benefits and challenges of targeting this market, and to examine the existing child-friendly tourism supply. The results, derived from the content analysis of 29 interviews with wineries’ managers, reveal that, despite an inclusive and receptive discourse towards the presence of children, the attractions still do not offer services and experiences specifically designed for this segment. Except for a few innovative attractions, families are welcomed with improvisations to entertain the little ones while their parents carry out wine-related activities.}

abstract = {The wide presence of the right to work in national and international legal texts contrasts with a lack of agreement about the concrete content of this right. According to the hegemonic interpretation, it consists of two elements: (a) extension of wage labour and (b) significant improvement of working conditions. However, if we study the history of right to work claims, especially from the French Revolution to 1848, we can notice that the meaning of this right was rather wider in the past. Rescuing the historical significance of the right to work may help to face the problem of the future of work. In particular, and unlike what might seem at first sight, the claim that everyone should have his or her right to work guaranteed can be a way of articulating and concretizing issues such as workplace democracy, the organization of domestic work or the transition to a sustainable society.}

abstract = {While a great deal is known in the agglomeration literature regarding the importance of having access to Marshallian externalities for firm performance, less is known about how geographically isolated and remote firms fare with the lack of such access. More recent literature suggests that firms, especially those within geographic proximity, can form a community of practice to facilitate deliberate learning and collectively create a shared repertoire, that is, a set of communal knowledge of procedures, techniques, and standards for best practices. Unlike Marshallian externalities, however, community of practice membership is not necessarily bounded by geography, and as such, isolated firms can also engage in a community of practice and unlock the shared repertoire for their own benefits. The study of the Ontario wine industry (1999–2009) finds that community of practice engagement weakens the detrimental impact of geographic isolation on firm performance, suggesting that isolated firms can tap into agglomeration benefits by engaging in a community of practice.}
