ABSTRACT = {The aroma profile of red wine is complex and research focusing on aroma compounds and their links to viticultural and enological practices is needed. Current research is limited to wines made from cold-hardy cultivars (interspecific hybrids of vinifera and native N. American grapes). The objective of this research was to develop a fully automated solid phase microextraction (SPME) method, using tandem gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-olfactometry for the simultaneous chemical and sensory analysis of volatile/semi-volatile compounds and aroma in cold-hardy red wines. Specifically, the effects of SPME coating selection, extraction time, extraction temperature, incubation time, sample volume, desorption time, and salt addition were studied. The developed method was used to determine the aroma profiles of seven selected red wines originating from four different cold-hardy grape cultivars. Thirty-six aroma compounds were identified from Maréchal Foch, St. Croix, Frontenac, Vincent, and a Maréchal Foch/Frontenac blend. Among these 36 aroma compounds, isoamyl alcohol, ethyl caproate, benzeneethanol, ethyl decanoate, and ethyl caproate are the top five most abundant aroma compounds. Olfactometry helps to identify compounds not identified by MS. The presented method can be useful for grape growers and wine makers for the screening of aroma compounds in a wide variety of wines and can be used to balance desired wine aroma characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {Precision viticulture is the application of site-specific techniques to vineyard production to improve grape quality and yield and minimize the negative effects on the environment. While there are various studies on the inherent spatial and temporal variability of vineyards, the assessment of the environmental impact of variable rate applications has attracted limited attention. In this study, two vineyards planted with different grapevine cultivars (Sauvignon Blanc and Syrah) were examined for four consecutive growing seasons (2013–2016). The first year, the two vineyards were only studied in terms of soil properties and crop characteristics, which resulted in the delineation of two distinct management zones for each field. For the following three years, variable rate nutrient application was applied to each management zone based on leaf canopy reflectance, where variable rate irrigation was based on soil moisture sensors, meteorological data, evapotranspiration calculation, and leaf canopy reflectance. Life cycle assessment was carried out to identify the effect of variable rate applications on vineyard agro-ecosystems. The results of variable rate nutrients and water application in the selected management zones as an average value of three growing seasons were compared to the conventional practice. It was found that the reduction of product carbon footprint (PCF) of grapes in Sauvignon Blanc between the two periods was 25% in total. Fertilizer production and distribution (direct) and application (indirect) was the most important sector of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, accounting for 17.2%, and the within-farm energy use was the second ranked sector with 8.8% (crop residue management increase GHG emissions by 1.1%, while 0.1% GHG reduction is obtained by pesticide use). For the Syrah vineyard, where the production was less intensive, precision viticulture led to a PCF reduction of 28.3% compared to conventional production. Fertilizers contributed to this decrease by 27.6%, while within-farm energy use had an impact of 2.2% that was positive even though irrigation was increased, due to yield rise. Our results suggest that nutrient status management offers the greatest potential for reducing GHG emissions in both vineyard types. Variable rate irrigation also showed differences in comparison to conventional treatment, but to a lesser degree than variable rate fertilization. This difference between conventional practices and precision viticulture is noteworthy, and shows the potential of precision techniques to reduce the effect of viticulture on GHG emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {Aroma is an important property of wine and it can be influenced significantly by enological practices. The aim of this work was, by use of stir bar sorptive extraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SBSE/GC-MS), to compare semi-quantitative concentrations of the volatile constituents of stainless steel tank-fermented/matured Huxelrebe, Ortega, Schönburger and Siegerrebe varietal wines from a commercial English vineyard, with corresponding wines produced by oak cask (‘barrel’) fermentation/maturation. Aroma profiles of tank and barrel wines were different, with more volatiles detected and net concentrations being higher in barrel wines. Long chain ethyl carboxylate esters were generally more abundant in barrel wines, whereas acetate esters were generally more prominent in tank wines. By conducting a short (~7 month) maturation period in secondhand (third or fourth fill) casks, it was possible to make wines with more complex aromas, but without obvious oak aroma.},

ABSTRACT = {Sustainable viticulture is suggested as an interesting strategy for achieving the objectives of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in terms of mitigation and adaptation. However, knowledge and quantification of the contribution of sustainable vineyard management on climate change impact are needed. Although it is widely assessed by several authors that the agricultural stage has a great impact in the wine chain, very few studies have evaluated the greenhouse gas emission in this phase including the ability of soil to sequester carbon (C) or the off-farm C loss by erosion. This work aimed to provide a vineyard carbon budget (vCB) tool to quantify the impact of grape production on GHG emission including the effects of environmental characteristics and agricultural practices. The vCB was estimated considering four different soil management scenarios: conventional tillage (CT), temporary cover crop with a leguminous species in alternate inter-rows (ACC), temporary cover crop with a leguminous species (CC), permanent cover crop (PCC). The estimation of vCB was applied at territory level in a viticulture area in Sicily (2468 ha of vineyard) using empirical data. Results of the present study showed that the environmental characteristics strongly affect the sustainability of vineyard management; the highest contribution to total CO2 emission is, in fact, given by the C losses by erosion in sloping vineyards. Soils of studied vineyards are a source of CO2 due to the low C inputs and high mineralization rate, except for soil managed by CC which can sequester soil C, contributing positively to vCB. The highest total CO2 emission was estimated in vineyards under CT management (2.31 t ha−1y−1), followed by CC (1.27 t ha−1y−1), ACC (0.69 t ha−1y−1) and PCC (0.64 t ha−1y−1). Findings of vCB applied at territory level highlighted the key role of the evaluation of carbon budget (CB) on a larger scale to identify the CO2 emission in relation to climatic and environmental factors. The present study could contribute to provide suggestions to policymakers and farmers for reducing GHG emissions and promote more sustainable grape production practices.},

ABSTRACT = {Northern Tajikistan creates favorable conditions for growing grapes due to its climate. The choice of method of grape production to ensure a high-quality yield, while reducing the negative effects of such production on the environment, poses a serious challenge to implementation regarding the principles of sustainable production. In addition to the essential techniques associated with grapevine production, such as irrigation, fertilization, and plant protection, a training system plays a significant role. The objective of this research was to evaluate the environmental efficiency of vineyard training systems in northern Tajikistan. The indicators accepted for the evaluation process were the vegetative growth of plants, yield, and environmental pressure of production expressed by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The single-factor experiment was conducted in Ghafurov District, and the following training systems were used: (A) multi-arm fan; (B) Umbrella Kniffin; (C) one-side multi-arm, paired planting. Growth parameters, yield, yield quality, and GHG emissions were evaluated. The cultivation of grapes in training system “C” resulted in higher values of parameters such as Practical Bud Fertility coefficient and fruiting shoots pcs and higher yields. The training systems were ranked according to GHG emissions per yield unit in the following order, from lower to higher emissions: C < B < A.},

ABSTRACT = {Soil management in vineyards is of fundamental importance not only for the productivity and quality of grapes, both in biological and conventional management, but also for greater sustainability of the production. Conservative soil management techniques play an important role, compared to conventional tillage, in order to preserve biodiversity, to save soil fertility, and to keep vegetative-productive balance. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate long-term adaptation strategies to create a balance between the vine and the surrounding environment. This work sought to assess the effects of following different management practices on Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon during 2017 and 2018 seasons: soil tillage (T), temporary cover cropping over all inter-rows (C), and mulching with plant residues every other row (M). The main physiological parameters of vines (leaf gas exchange, stem water potential, chlorophyll fluorescence, and indirect chlorophyll content) as well as qualitative and quantitative grape parameters (technological and phenolic analyses) were measured. Significant differences in gas exchanges related to the different season and inter-row management were observed. C showed more negative values of water potential, due to the grass–vine competition, especially when water availability was lower. The competition exerted by C led to differences in fruit setting with impact on yield; therefrom, significant differences also in sugar and anthocyanic content were observed.},

ABSTRACT = {Unlike most crop industries, there is a strongly held belief within the wine industry that increased vine age correlates with quality. Considering this perception could be explained by vine physiological differences, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of vine age on phenology and gas exchange parameters. An interplanted, dry farmed, Zinfandel vineyard block under consistent management practices in the Central Coast of California was evaluated over two consecutive growing seasons. Treatments included Young vines (5 to 12 years old), Control (representative proportion of young to old vines in the block), and Old vines (40 to 60 years old). Phenology, leaf water potential, and gas exchange parameters were tracked. Results indicated a difference in phenological progression after berry set between Young and Old vines. Young vines progressed more slowly during berry formation and more rapidly during berry ripening, resulting in Young vines being harvested before Old vines due to variation in the timing of sugar accumulation. No differences in leaf water potential were found. Young vines had higher mid-day stomatal conductance and tended to have higher mid-day photosynthetic rates. The results of this study suggest vine age is a factor in phenological timing and growing season length.},

ABSTRACT = {Given that the global winegrape planting area is 7.2 × 106 hm2, the potential for winegrape crop-mediated carbon capture and storage as an approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions warranted further research. Herein, we employed an allometric model of various winegrape organs to assess biomass distributions, and we evaluated the carbon storage distribution characteristics associated with vineyard ecosystems in the Hongsibu District of Ningxia. We found that the total carbon storage of the Vitis vinifera ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ vineyard ecosystem was 55.35 t·hm−2, of which 43.12 t·hm−2 came from the soil, while the remaining 12.23 t·hm−2 was attributable to various vine components including leaves (1.85 t·hm−2), fruit (2.16 t·hm−2), canes (1.83 t·hm−2), perennial branches (2.62 t·hm−2), and roots (3.78 t·hm−2). Together, these results suggested that vineyards can serve as an effective carbon sink, with the majority of carbon being sequestered at the soil surface. Within the grapevines themselves, most carbon was stored in perennial organs including perennial branches and roots. Allometric equations based on simple and practical biomass and biometric measurements offer a means whereby grape-growers and government entities responsible for ecological management can better understand carbon distribution patterns associated with vineyards.},

ABSTRACT = {The aroma of grapes is cultivar dependent and is influenced by terroir, vineyard practices, and abiotic and biotic stresses. Trincadeira is a non-aromatic variety associated with low phenolic content and high sugar and organic acid levels. This cultivar, widely used in Portuguese wines, presents high susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea. This work aimed to characterise the volatile profile of Trincadeira grapes and how it changes under infection with B. cinerea. Thirty-six volatile organic compounds were identified, from different functional groups, namely alcohols, ester acetates, fatty acid esters, fatty acids, aldehydes, and products of the lipoxygenase pathway. Both free and glycosidic volatile organic compounds were analysed by Gas Chromatography and Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry for component quantification and identification, respectively. A multivariance analysis showed a clear discrimination between healthy and infected grapes with 2-trans-hexenal and isoamyl-acetate among the compounds identified as negative and positive markers of infection, respectively. Ester acetates such as 2-phenylethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, and 2-methylbutyl acetate were present in higher contents in infected samples, whereas the contents of several fatty acid esters, such as ethyl decanoate and ethyl dodecanoate, decreased. These data were integrated with quantitative PCR data regarding genes involved in volatile metabolism and showed up-regulation of a gene coding for Hydroperoxide Lyase 2 in infected grapes. Altogether, these changes in volatile metabolism indicate an impact on the grape quality and may be related to defence against B. cinerea. The presence/absence of specific compounds might be used as infection biomarkers in the assessment of Trincadeira grapes’ quality.},

ABSTRACT = {Rising temperatures in most viticultural regions are associated with a higher incidence of drastic weather circumstances such as heatwaves. The consequences are reflected in qualitative and quantitative white grapes characteristics. In fact, there is an enhancement in alcohol content and a jeopardized reduction in the aromatic potential. We performed a scientific test to assuage the bump of heatwaves and exposure of grapes on Vitis vinifera cv. “Sauvignon Blanc” with exposed vines (untreated) or with kaolin foliar treatment or with partial fruit-zone shading (shading net 30 and 70%). This work aimed to evaluate the effects of shading net (SD-30% and SD-70%) and foliar kaolin (K) treatment on physiology, technological maturity, and thiolic precursors in Italy during the 2020–2021 seasons. For this purpose, four treatments were established: SD-30% (green artificial shading net at 30%), SD-70% (green artificial shading net at 70%), K (foliar kaolin), and CTRL (no application). During the two vintages, single-leaf gas exchange appraisal, leaf temperature, berry temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence, pre-dawn, and leaf water potential were measured. Moreover, berry weight, pH, °Brix, acidity (technological maturity specifications), and the following thiolic precursors were analyzed: 3-S-glutathionylhexan-1-ol (Glut-3MH), S-4-(4-methylpentan-2-one)-L-cysteine (Cys-4MMP), and 3-S-cysteinylhexan-1-ol (Cys-3MH). SD-70% and K denoted less negative water potential, a lower berry temperature, and a higher level of all precursors than the other treatments. Acidity and sugar parameters indicated significant differences among treatments. The lower berry weight and the lower tartaric acidity were found in the CTRL treatment. In comparison, SD-70% and K showed lower and more balanced sugar contents. As a result of global warming, color shading net and kaolin have been demonstrated to be good practices to counterpoise the divergence between aromatic and technological maturity in Sauvignon Blanc grapevines.},

ABSTRACT = {The water content in an agricultural crop is of crucial importance and can either be estimated through proximal or remote sensing techniques, allowing better irrigation scheduling and avoiding extreme water stress periods. However, the current climate change context is increasing the use of eco-friendly practices to reconcile water management and thermal protection from sunburn. These approaches aim to mitigate summer stress factors (high temperature, high radiation, and water shortage) and improve the plants’ thermal efficiency. In this study, data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were used to monitor the efficiency of foliar kaolin application (5%) in a commercial vineyard. Thermal infrared imagery (TIR) was used to compare the canopy temperature of grapevines with and without kaolin and to compute crop water stress and stomatal conductance indices. The gas exchange parameters of single leaves were also analysed to ascertain the physiological performance of vines and validate the UAV-based TIR data. Generally, plants sprayed with kaolin presented a lower temperature compared to untreated plants. Moreover, UAV-based data also showed a lower water stress index and higher stomatal conductance, which relate to eco-physiological measurements carried out in the field. Thus, the suitability of UAV-based TIR data proved to be a good approach to monitor entire vineyards in regions affected by periods of heatwaves, as is the case of the analysed study area.},

ABSTRACT = {The viticultural sector is facing a significant maturation phase, dealing with environmental challenges to reduce agrochemical application and energy consumption, while labor shortages are increasing throughout Europe and beyond. Autonomous collaborative robots are an emerging technology and an alternative to the scarcity of human labor in agriculture. Additionally, collaborative robots could provide sustainable solutions to the growing energy demand of the sector due to their skillful precision and continuous labor. This study presents an impact assessment regarding energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of collaborative robots in four Greek vineyards implementing a life cycle assessment approach. Eight scenarios were developed in order to assess the annual production of four Vitis vinifera L. cultivars, namely, Asyrtiko, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Tempranillo, integrating data from two wineries for 3 consecutive years. For each conventional cultivation scenario, an alternative was developed, substituting conventional viticultural practices with collaborative robots. The results showed that collaborative robots’ scenarios could achieve a positive environmental and energy impact compared with conventional strategies. The major reason for lower impacts is fossil fuel consumption and the efficiency of the selected robots, though there are limitations regarding their functionality, lifetime, and production. The alternative scenarios have varying energy demand and environmental impact, potentially impacting agrochemical usage and requiring new policy adjustments, leading to increased complexity and potential controversy in farm management. In this context, this study shows the benefits of collaborative robots intended to replace conventional practices in a number of viticultural operations in order to cope with climate change impacts and excessive energy consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {For oenological products, most of the intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of perceived quality are associated with specific aromatic profiles. Aromatic diversity has been recognized as a central element in perceived quality as it is able to transmit the complex interactions between grape variety, geographical characteristics, and viticultural and winemaking practices, including the fermentative process. A comprehensive characterization of flavour compounds by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric analysis is often needed in order to ascertain the quality of wine. HS-SPME requires a proper optimization that can be achieved through an adequate experimental design. Here, a HS-SPME/GC-MS based method was developed to investigate the volatile compounds of wine samples obtained by laboratory-scale fermentations. This was performed by inoculating a commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, which is used both as single starter and as mixed starter, with an indigenous Hanseniaspora osmophila strain. The experimental conditions of HS-SPME (extraction temperature and time) were optimized by applying a face-centred composite experimental design. Up to 95% of the total variance was explained by the proposed model. The optimized method allowed us to confirm the usefulness of combining the inoculation of grapes with selected yeast strains in co-culture situations in order to improve the wine bouquet.},

ABSTRACT = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are influenced by physical, chemical, biological, and anthropogenic factors. The objective of the study is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the emissions of three important agricultural GHGs (CO2, N2O, and CH4) in both rows and alleys of a vineyard (1) and to understand their interactions with the agricultural operations carried out in the experimental plot, namely tillage, inter-row management, application of mineral and organic fertilizers, and irrigation and pruning, as well as the agroclimatic conditions of the plot (2). The study was conducted in a vineyard of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Tempranillo blanco in the DOCa. Rioja grape-growing region, during 2017, 2018, and 2019. Cumulative CO2 emissions were highest in 2018, reaching 934.7 ± 66.5 kg ha−1 day−1 in the alleys and 926.8 ± 76.5 kg ha−1 day−1 in the rows, in agreement with the wetter year and organic matter decomposition at the end of 2017. N2O emissions during the three-year study were mainly affected by mineral fertilizer application, with increases of 41.1 g ha−1 day−1 in the alleys and 49.3 g ha−1 day−1 in the rows during 2018, and 33.1 g ha−1 day−1 in the alleys and 39.6 g ha−1 day−1 in the rows in 2019. Regarding CH4, anaerobic soil conditions in 2018 (the year with the highest rainfall) led to the highest flux of CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, with 215.5 ± 51.0 g ha−1 day−1 in the corridors and 238.4 ± 54.9 g ha−1 day−1 in the rows. This study emphasizes the complex interplay of physical, chemical, biological, and human-related factors affecting GHG emissions in viticultural soils. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing sustainable vineyard practices that minimize emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to compare the aroma profiles of Sorbara and Spergola grapevine prunings roasted at different temperatures (120, 140, 160, 180, 200, and 240 °C). One potential application of grapevine prunings is their use as infusion chips to enhance and improve the aging processes of alcoholic beverages and vinegars. Aromatic compounds impart unique flavors and contribute to the complexity of the final products. Thermogravimetry–mass spectrometry coupled with evolved gas analysis (TGA-MS-EGA) was conducted to identify the thermal steps at which substantial changes occurred in the wood matrix. Solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) was used for the analysis of volatile compounds. Several key volatile compounds were identified, showing variations in their concentrations as a function of cultivar and roasting temperature. Furan derivatives, such as furfural, and phenolic compounds, such as guaiacol and vanillin, were the two main chemical classes of volatile compounds that predominantly defined the aroma of grapevine chips roasted above 180 °C. At lower roasting temperatures, some aldehydes, such as hexanal and terpenes, defined the aroma profiles of the samples.
