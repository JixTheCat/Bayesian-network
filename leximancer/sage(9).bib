abstract = {Researchers and practitioners continue to call for professional learning (PL) for multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS) to promote implementation with fidelity. Different PL interventions and MTSS frameworks raise questions about what types of PL support educators to engage in key practices. Questions also remain regarding educators’ perspectives and experiences with PL for MTSS and factors that facilitate or hinder educators’ learning. In this paper, we report findings from a qualitative research synthesis on PL for MTSS in the United States. We found 46 studies that explored educators’ perspectives and experiences with PL. Findings illuminated educators’ positive experiences with ongoing, job-embedded PL, particularly PL communities and coaching. Studies also illustrated the importance of collaboration and trust within learning communities as well as leaders who empower and trust educators. We discuss the implications of these findings in K–12 school settings.}

abstract = {The “labor border” is an analytical tool, a legal device for controlling incoming migration flows through government initiatives related to the employment system. Two programs for temporary legalization of migrants implemented by the Mexican government in the context of the so-called Central American exodus—the Estas en Tu Casa (You Are at Home) plan and the Emisión de Tarjetas de Visitante por Razones Humanitarias (Issuance of Visitor Cards for Humanitarian Reasons) program—are examples of such devices. A review based on recent research on their impacts on the mobility of migrants as they cross the southern Mexican border on their way to the United States contributes to the debate over the outsourcing of border controls in the framework of the dependent relationship between Mexican migration policy and U.S. security strategy. La “frontera laboral” es una herramienta analítica, un dispositivo legal para controlar los flujos migratorios entrantes a través de iniciativas gubernamentales relacionadas con el sistema de empleo. Dos programas de legalización temporal de migrantes implementados por el gobierno mexicano en el contexto del llamado éxodo centroamericano—el plan Estas en Tu Casa y el programa Emisión de Tarjetas de Visitante por Razones Humanitarias—son un ejemplo de dichos dispositivos. Una revisión basada en investigaciones recientes sobre sus impactos en la movilidad de los migrantes al cruzar la frontera sur de México en su camino hacia los Estados Unidos contribuye al debate sobre la externalización de los controles fronterizos en el marco de la relación de dependencia entre la política migratoria mexicana y la estrategia de seguridad de los Estados Unidos.}

abstract = {This article addresses the sensitive, religious-political issue of the promised land. It discusses this issue from the perspective of the criticism of the promised land in the works of Walter Brueggemann in comparison to his artistic source of influence, John Steinbeck. After the systematic analysis of Brueggemann’s criticism of land ideology throughout his work, I elaborate on Steinbeck’s critical attitude to this topic which I offer as Steinbeck’s own alternative criticism. On top of the affirmation that “Steinbeck may have put the issue of the land most eloquently,” as suggested by Brueggemann himself, I propose that Steinbeck (unlike Brueggemann) does not fall into the trap of producing an inverted ideology and offers a balanced and timeless criticism of the promised land issue.}

It was arguably the most unique textile mill village ever built in New England. The article begins with a discussion of the motivation for the project. It then shifts to a summary of the critical features of Wood’s vision and identifies the historic institutional paths that informed him. This is followed by an analysis of how the plan was successfully implemented and an explanation of what happened to Shawsheen over time. The article ends with an interpretation of the significance of the Shawsheen experience in the context of the history of New England mill towns.}

abstract = {This article explores Ruth’s theology of resilience amidst vulnerability: a resilience rooted in ḥesed (loving kindness, a generosity beyond the call of duty). Ḥesed is a powerful social force that could address current issues for those both in privileged positions and in vulnerable situations. A re-reading of Ruth offers modern theologians and serious students of the Bible pathways towards building resilience amidst vulnerability, and in caring for those in vulnerable positions. The text at hand offers a pathway to be true to one’s core values and character, even amidst desperate situations. In Ruth resilience is developed by caring for others, identifying with a particular faith community, and taking initiatives while maintaining integrity. The narrative unveils a sustainable life of resilience that happens when one’s private and public life is lived congruently to each other. This article also reads Ruth’s narrative through a lens of a minority foreign woman that uses feminist and post-colonial approaches while looking at Ruth through a hermeneutic of trust. First, the author identifies her assumptions and considerations. Secondly, the article examines resilience as rooted in one’s identity and explores ḥesed under cultural and spiritual frameworks, within the narrative of Ruth and Naomi’s road scene from Moab to Bethlehem. Lastly, it examines resilience as rooted in ḥesed, within the narrative of the threshing floor scene encounter between Ruth and Boaz. The road and threshing floor scenes are decisive moments for Ruth. Her words and actions in each instance reveal her resilience: her strength of mind, emotion, and spirit, in spite of her vulnerability.}

abstract = {Throughout John Cassian’s Institutes, he regularly exhorts his readers to ascetic discretion and moderation. He refers to this path of discretion as the ‘royal road’. To the left is negligence and acquiescence to temptation. On the right is over-zealous ascetic endeavors that often leave one weak and vulnerable to unclean thoughts and temptation. The royal road, meanwhile, is paved with ascetic moderation and continual discernment of one’s thoughts. This image of the royal road can be seen at work in Cassian’s discussions of grace and free will in both Institutes and Conferences. This royal road is also at work in his Christological treatise, On the Incarnation. Cassian positions Nestorius’ christology among the various heretics on the left and right of the tradition of the fathers that commits itself to the mysterious union of divinity and humanity in Christ.}
