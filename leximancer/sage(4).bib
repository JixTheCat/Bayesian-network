abstract = {New conceptualizations propose the concept of terroir as referring to a place of distinctiveness that is able to create marketing value. However, the knowledge regarding the role of terroir in tourism marketing is still scarce. Specifically, the concept of resident commitment has received little attention in research on tourism marketing, and therefore there is a gap in knowledge on the components of resident commitment and the role it can play in the construction or renewal of a tourist destination. To fill this gap, the purpose of this study is to analyze the role of residents’ commitment in consideration of terroir as referring to both a winegrowing region and a place of residence. The study aims to determine how residents’ commitment interacts with the brand dimensions identified in the marketing literature and consumer behavior research. In our theoretical framework we presented the wine terroir commitment (WTC) as a multidimensional grassroots construct and we empirically verified it by conducting a survey in a wine region, the Eisacktal Valley in South Tyrol (Italy). The findings show that Terroir Identification and Terroir Loyalty are two important antecedents of WTC as they mediate the exogenous latent variables of Terroir Prestige, and Wine Involvement as well as Resident Commitment and Terroir Experience, respectively. In the conclusions, we derive some recommendations for scholars and practitioners.}

abstract = {Wellness value is a neglected research area within the field of wine tourism. The connection between wine and wellness in this context is just starting to appear. Using an inductive approach, we established two research questions (RQs) to guide this study. RQ1: Who is concerned with the health-related values of wine tourism? RQ2: What are the dimensions of health-related values in wine tourism? An in-depth and semi-structured interview was conducted. Informants aged 18–45 years, who have health awareness and suffer from wellness problems, are concerned with health-related values in wine tourism. Findings indicated six relevant dimensions: wine health attributes, knowledge, wine destination attributes, mental benefits, social and space needs, and wellness facilities. Further, this study proposes a conceptual framework linking wine-drinking behaviour and destination facilities and attributes with affective and cognitive beliefs that contribute to the overall value of wellness. This proposition shifts the traditional affective and cognitive approach towards values.}

After exploring the ambivalent nature of the word ‘exploitation’, with both positive and negative senses, the article reviews some earlier contributions to the historical accounting research literature relevant to the Special Issue. The four substantive research papers in the Special Issue are discussed and put into broader contexts, and the article identifies some potentially fruitful avenues for further research into how accounting has been implicated in the exploitation of the natural world in the past. The article concludes with brief tributes to two recently deceased accounting academics, Professor Tom Schneider and Professor Mike Jones, whose contributions to the Special Issue and to stimulating research into accounting for biodiversity, respectively, are acknowledged.}

abstract = {Urban agricultural heritage is an essential subject when investigating urban history. The preservation of it contributes to inheriting farming traditions, supporting local food, and reinforcing the cities’ cultural identity. To emphasize the significance and urgency of preserving urban agricultural heritage, this article first describes the concept of urban agricultural heritage from historical, ecological, social, and economic dimensions. We then choose the traditional urban grape garden in the Ancient City of Xuanhua as a case study. According to a new method we have developed, we provide a comprehensive description of the existing issues in the grape garden and the external factors that impact the study area. The results show that the traditional farming technique has been inherited; the urban fabric of courtyards containing grape funnels has not changed; the study area still lacks social concerns; and a part of households should optimize their business models.}

abstract = {How did people come to ‘think Neolithic’? While there has been considerable progress in reconstructing the environmental, economic, technological and social changes associated with the transition from mobile hunter-gathering to sedentary farming and herding communities, we remain limited in our understanding of how Neolithic culture in its most profound sense arose. I suggest that the formation of new words required for that new lifestyle was as much a driver as a consequence of the Neolithic transition, illustrating this with a sample of Neolithic innovations from the southern Levant that appears likely to have required new words. Such words, I argue, helped to establish new concepts in the mind, shaped thought, influenced perception and ultimately the human deeds in the world that left an archaeological trace.}

abstract = {My paper wishes to delve into concepts such as assemblage and sympoiesis and examine them within the framework of my ethnographic fieldwork on beekeeping in the Western chain of the Italian Alps. I believe that the implications of notions such as sympoiesis and assemblage can be seen to surface in the context of beekeeping and bee culture, as they emerge as multispecies activities where everything and everyone involved can be regarded as a social actor. In this respect, the most relevant issues I would like to tackle are referred to knowledge production and know-how among beekeepers who keep their apiaries in the plains for most part of the year and move them to mountain areas for the summer.}
