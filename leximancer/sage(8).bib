abstract = {The personal and individualistic bias of contemporary Bible reading can hide the primary message of Scripture. Attention to communal and social contexts of reading, such as economic and political structures of the time, opens greater understanding of the historical world in which texts are written, as well as the economic and political message for contemporary readers. A re-reading of the first twelve chapters of Isaiah demonstrates the way that psychologizing and spiritualizing texts obscures their relevance to current social conditions. Isaiah addresses sin and idolatry, topics familiar to personalizing readers; however, in Isaiah the topics are tightly interwoven with economic life. Other prominent contemporary issues that take the foreground in Isaiah 1–12 are property foreclosure and seizure, unlivable wages, wage theft, mistreatment of workers, unjust laws favoring the wealthy, influence of money in political systems, and irresponsible leadership. Concepts of Jubilee economics, themes in the Torah and subsequently in Jesus’ teaching, pervade the criticism of Israel and Judah in these prophetic texts.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the influence of accreditations on tourism demand, namely, World Heritage List (WHL) designations and Geographical Indications (GIs). The analysis examines Italian data at the NUTS3 level spanning from 1999 to 2019. Contribution of the study is two-fold. Firstly, by utilizing a Difference-in-Differences model in conjunction with Propensity Score Matching (PSM-DiD), the study evaluates the impact of jointly recognizing both accreditations as a binary treatment (yes/no). Secondly, by employing Generalised Propensity Score Matching (GPSM) for continuous treatment, the study gauges how the impact of the two accreditations is contingent on the number of recognitions (consistency). These impact assessments concern both domestic and international tourists. Conclusions highlight the positive effects, encompassing tourism arrivals, overnight stays, and tourist expenditures, associated with both the combined recognition (PSM-DiD) and the consistency of accreditation (GPSM). These findings support the implementation of place-based policies promoting diverse local assets, notably cultural heritage and agri-food excellence.}

abstract = {This article explores how local actors in Buffalo and Cleveland mobilized through garden tourism as a form of alternative urbanism to rehabilitate heavily stigmatized places and remake their city’s reputations. Buidling off the concepts of civic action and scene styles, I compare how grassroots actors in Buffalo mobilized through a symbolic purity scene style to deracialize urban stigmas to how grassroots actors in Cleveland mobilized through a diversity scene style to create an inclusive place reputation that addressed the city’s internal racial and ethnic divsions. I found that in the process of rehabbing their communities, grassroots actors in both cities replaced racialized urban stigmas with a different form of Whiteness, and when residents and elites shared the same scene style, they were more likely to cooperate, which entrenched the garden tour with local elites and other organizations in the cultural tourism field. Cultural variables like a place’s reputation matter in how and what kind of Rust Belt city will emerge from the era of urban shrinkage.

abstract = {During the past two decades, a growing number of universities, mainly from developed countries, have established branch campuses in developing countries. From the developing country perspective, attracting foreign universities can help mitigate financial constraints and capacity shortages that impair the state’s ability to provide greater access to higher education, while also improving teaching and research in general. However, foreign universities may also be detrimental if they crowd out their domestic counterparts. We explore different scenarios and policy options for developing countries aiming to attract foreign universities, building upon a review of four case studies from Chile, China, Kazakhstan, and Malaysia. Our analysis illustrates how host countries can provide incentives to align incoming foreign universities to complement and strengthen the areas of weakness in their higher education systems. We also reflect on how policy-makers can deal with the challenges associated with the dual embeddedness of international branch campuses.}

abstract = {Sport leagues have been critiqued for their cartel-like behavior, monopsony power, and many occupational health risks to athletes. Athlete-owned sports leagues are an alternative way of organizing professional sport that may benefit athletes and the industry. This article examines the viability of athlete-owned leagues by reviewing theory and research on worker-owned firms and applying the findings to sports leagues with athlete ownership, with a focus on the Premier Lacrosse League. Five criteria are shown to affect the viability of worker ownership: heterogeneity of interests, capital-labor ratios, time horizons, motivation and efficiency, and conflict with capitalists. When applied to the sport industry, athlete ownership is likely in sports like beach volleyball and skateboarding but unlikely in sports like American football and soccer. Athlete-owned sports leagues have some benefits when compared with capitalist-owned leagues, but they will struggle in markets with incumbents.}

abstract = {The priestly account of creation in Gen 1:1-2:3 provides the basis for the weekly Sabbath, centering the command to rest in God’s creative activity. The Ten Commandments not only require that servants be allowed to rest but also extend this requirement to those animals that are dependent on and work for humans (Exod 20:8-11; Deut 5:12-15), connecting the Sabbath to both social justice and creation care. The Sabbath principle is connected to care for the poor in laws that extend the pattern of rest from days to years. After 6 years of work, slaves are released (Exod 21:1-6; Deut 15:12-18), debts are forgiven in a universal seventh year (Deut 15:1-11), and fields are left fallow for the poor of the land and the beasts of the field every seventh year (Exod 23:10-11). The Holiness Code (Lev 17-26) uses the Sabbath principle as an organizing factor in Israel’s life and calendar. For the Holiness Code, the Sabbath year is a Sabbath of the land. The Sabbath Year is a call to creation care for the earth itself, and, should humans fail in their duty, God asserts that the land will be allowed its Sabbaths without humans.}
