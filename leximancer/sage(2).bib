abstract = {In this study we analyse how three cities in the arid Americas have addressed urban growth while facing water scarcity: Hermosillo, Mexico; Mendoza, Argentina; and Tucson, USA. We use the urban water security framework to examine five domains of water management: sociodemographic, economic, technological, ecological and governance (SETEG). Our analysis indicates that, in spite of water scarcity, urban growth has been promoted in the three cities. We argue that this expansion, although encouraged for economic development, is not sustainable in the long term. In the three cities, groundwater plays a major role in water supply, but growth has negatively affected riparian ecosystems, the health of the aquifers and access to domestic water. In order to pursue water security, several options are essential to enhance social–ecological system resilience. These include limits or reduction of urban expansion, reuse of treated effluent for riparian conservation, and community conservation efforts such as rainwater harvesting and other green infrastructure practices.}

abstract = {The paper contributes to the recent renaissance in Marxian land rent theory by examining the dynamics of rent in the context of contemporary urban sustainability policies and practices. It specifically examines the ways in which landowners, developers, and the local state work together to pursue class monopoly rent through a variety of policies and practices normally treated as separate, such as tax-increment financing, discursive-branding, urban growth boundaries, business improvement districts, and transfer of development rights. We implicate each of these practices as fundamentally linked insofar as they function as strategies for myriad invested actors in collaboratively pursuing class monopoly rent. In the process, we present a heuristic tool to conceptualize how these policies converge to the benefit of myriad rent seekers in the context of Seattle’s rapidly redeveloping South Lake Union District. The study peels back the discursive and ostensibly progressive façade of urban sustainability to reveal a collaborative network of landowners, developers, and state actors whose goal is to increase rents. The multi-scalar dynamic of class monopoly rent is revealed as a constitutive feature of an urban sustainability fix embedded within wider processes of uneven neoliberal urbanization.}

abstract = {Determining the price point is a vexing problem for firms: price too high and there is no market, but price too low and money is left on the table. Complicating matters further, for many goods there is a secondary market where products can be resold following the initial sale by the firm. Here, the open market determines the price point that end consumers pay. Often that price is higher than the price offered by the firm for goods such as premium handbags, wine, high-end watches, and works of art, so the consumer will see the product’s quality or appeal validated by the market, which leads to a reputation gain for the firm. This phenomenon goes beyond physical products and includes a variety of services, such as live concerts, as reflected in their ticket prices in primary and secondary markets. However, the secondary market can also offer a lower price than the firm’s original offering, which hurts the firm’s reputation. Typically, the luxury market equates higher prices with higher status but neglects the impact of the secondary market. Our research considers the case where initially underpricing a good may be in a luxury firm’s long-term interest. Although underpricing has been used in initial public offering (IPO) markets to increase the firm’s reputation, it has been viewed as a problem or discouraged in other market industries. Our hypothesis is that reputation has long-term value for firms and, in industries where a visible secondary (i.e., resale) market exists for products, price increases after product release lead to gains in reputation as higher resale prices signal quality and value.}

abstract = {Within the framework of the global climate crisis and its specific effect of the mega-drought affecting dryland agriculture in the central-southern area of Chile, this study analyzes peasant wineries as a historical and collaborative commons, with traditional and agroecological knowledge and practices, which is organized and represents an important pluriverse for climate resilience. This takes place despite the threat of dispossession and multiple enclosures associated with the advance of industrial-level wineries and corporate forest plantations. The text analyzes the ways that small winegrowers in the Itata and Cauquenes Valleys protect their heritage and income by integrating interdisciplinary contributions from geology (evaluating climate change manifestations in their valleys), social sciences (observing the care and production practices of the wine-growing commons), and law (analyzing possible legal frameworks to develop in this common defense). All these actions are integrated from an analytical framework of political ecology and climate justice. In these experiences, we recognize multiple elements of climate resilience adapted to the agroecological conditions of dryland farming, showing that wineries are an activity which can protect the local territory and provide climate justice, contributing to protecting cultural heritage and socioenvironmental well-being in communities.}

abstract = {Organic and biodynamic methods of cultivation present particular challenges for the production of wine in a terroir-based system. This remains underexplored in academic work, yet it represents the confluence of two important contemporary trends in the wine industry. In this article, I draw upon interviews and participant observation with wine producers in the French region of Burgundy to examine emergent tensions between terroir and environmentally sustainable modes of production. Following an introduction to the subject, in the first section of the article I show how claims made about vineyard soils operated within the context of a simultaneously agronomic, environmental and cultural notion of terroir. In the second, I show how organic and biodynamic wine producers drew my attention to ecological dimensions of terroir by reference to things that could be appreciated aesthetically in the landscape. Reflecting on producers’ opinions, media coverage and wider scholarship, I make some initial steps in examining how environmentally sustainable modes of production are rhetorically and practically mobilised in the service of the widely shared notion of terroir, and, by extension, how these modes of production shape the sense of terroir that is promulgated in the cultural, economic and political organisation of wine.}

abstract = {The industrial mussel processing generates significant quantities of waste. Nearly 30% of one metric tonne of processed mussel is finally destined for human consumption. Regardless of the mussel commodities, an important quantity of waste is concentrated at several sub-processes, such as input reception, washing and declumping shells, and mussel meat extraction stages, or by means of the rejection of mussels only due to a size characteristic criterion established by the target market. Despite the main segregated waste comprising shells, byssus threads, residual meat and wastewater, a heterogeneous composition must be taken into account, since much of the solid waste is commonly gathered and compacted for landfill transportation purposes. This paper reviews the sustainable management strategies for mussel by-products, addressing their limitations for an industrial implementation to obtain value-added products. It is concluded that, although there is a well-known diversity of waste sustainable management alternatives, several proposed products (e.g., collagen, bio-adhesives, biopolymer, and adsorbent for pollutants) still remain in a potential framework, circumscribed into laboratory results, subject to an optimization process, to a validation by industrial pre-scale trials, or even limited by the associated production costs. Future researches should focus on reducing the uncertainties linked with their technical–economic feasibility for an industrial scale development.}

abstract = {This study explains how managers’ perceptions of pressure from competitors and industry associations to adopt environmental practices are associated with the adoption of such practices, and firm performance in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in fragmented industries. First, we hypothesize, in fragmented industries, perceived weaker competitive pressure focuses SME managers’ attention on opportunities associated with the adoption of environmental practices, resulting in further adoption of such practices. We also hypothesize that perceived stronger competitive pressure focuses managers’ attention on competitive threats and efforts to maximize value creation from adopted practices, thus, positively moderating the relationship between adopted environmental practices and financial performance. We test our hypotheses with survey data from wineries and vineyards in Italy, France, Denmark, and the United States, and find support for both hypotheses. These findings deepen our understanding of how SMEs in fragmented industries respond to perceived competitive pressure to adopt environmental practices.}
