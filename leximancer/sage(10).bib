abstract = {Interpretation of a text can either justify power relations and subordination or become a tool for empowerment. While some explain that the speaker is admitting a unique quality in Song 1:5, others think it is an affirmation of identity. This paper presents the views of young Ghanaian girls in two Senior High Schools. A contextual reading of the Song of Songs 1.5–17 is used to present strategies for self-empowerment, confidence, and creativity. Drawing from Africa Agenda 2063, it proposes ways to clarify beliefs about oneself and empower young people to tell their stories about their bodies. When Africans read the Bible, they also look for ways for redefining, rethinking, and re-living in an African community so that they can express their identity better.}

abstract = {Resilience is a helpful construct when considering how to support clergy well-being. The purpose of this study was to gain knowledge about clergy resilience, specifically those resources that clergy perceived had supported their professional resilience. The study gave attention to aspects of preservice training and professional development that helped to foster clergy resilience and initiatives that clergy desired to further support their resilience. Clergy reported multiple resources that supported their resilience including supports for spiritual life, relational supports, personal aspects, and organizational practices. Spiritual dimensions of support for resilience were prominent for clergy, especially the centrality of calling to ministry, theological meaning-making, and relationship with God. Participants also revealed helpful aspects of preservice training and professional development. Aspects of preservice training included rigorous discernment and screening of their callings and the inclusion of required practices, such as spiritual direction or mentorship. Aspects of professional development included a variety of skill development opportunities, lifelong learning, conferences, and networking with peers. Participants reported their desire for initiatives that included more wellness opportunities and an increased organizational prioritization of clergy wellness.}

abstract = {I argue that Augustine can inform contemporary republicanism in a way that has not yet been considered: by means of the utility of “overlapping consensus.” I first unpack Philip Pettit’s theory of republicanism and demonstrate that his work contains a significant “blind-spot,” namely, more deliberation is required than Pettit allows to establish “arbitrary” interference in the lives of citizens for the sake of maximizing non-domination. But the deliberative settings leave an opening for domination through rhetoric. It is here that Augustine enters: although both the Confessions and City of God contain multiple striking examples of the use of rhetoric, they also provide evidence of a distrust of rhetoric given its potential for domination. It is only in Book IV of De Doctrina Christiana that Augustine lays out explicitly and theoretically a positive use of rhetoric. I then argue that, to minimize domination in the deliberative settings required to better understand the changing definition of “arbitrary” interference, Pettit may profitably look to Augustine’s explicit theoretical conceptualization of rhetoric. I end by pointing out that this does not require accepting Augustine’s ontology and metaphysics. Indeed, through an overlapping consensus, agreement may be reached on rhetorical practices that do not contribute to domination.}

abstract = {The relationship between Dionysiac and emerging Christian traditions has long exercised biblical and classical scholars. Dionysianism is complex because of both its constituent mythologies and the fluidity and variety of its rituals. Emerging Christianity similarly defies a single metanarrative. This essay notes the difficulties of comparing Dionysiac tradition with just one early Christian text: the Gospel of John. The variety of Dionysiac material, the particular issues raised by critical readings of the Gospel (content and composition), the difficulty of overarching theological terminology (like “sacramentalism”), intertextuality, and mimesis criticism are all problematic when comparing the two traditions and their texts.}

abstract = {This article aims to investigate violent demonstrations in marginal territories of Santiago de Chile and their political dimension, studying the territorial deployment of structural violence, transgressive protest actions, and subjectivation processes. These three dimensions tell us about the political, social, and territorial intertwining of violent demonstrations, based on Jacques Rancière’s framework. We conducted a case study in Lo Hermida, a highly politicized self-constructed neighborhood born in the 1970s that is currently surrounded by transportation infrastructure and upscale urban developments. Using secondary sources, semi-structured interviews, and photo-elicitation with 14 residents of Lo Hermida, we show the way in which structural violence is experienced across the territory, how transgressive protest actions are carried out in violent demonstrations throughout it, and how processes of political subjectivation unfold from this. The conclusions emphasize the incorporation of the political-subjective dimension in the understanding of violence in marginal territories, highlighting its emergent characteristics in space.}

The methodology used response to the historical-grammatical method and belongs to the line of biblical-theological research, in which an exegesis of 4:1–3 is made. The results indicate that the reason why Jonah fled from his responsibility is that he considered that this mission was a waste of time and resources. He is sure that the warning he was going to provide would produce true but not lasting repentance in Nineveh, which would then return to his cruel and wild habits with the nations they will conquer.}

Governments have founded special educational institutions for these individuals, designed environments in which they could use and develop their distinct characteristics and skills for the sake of their countries as required by citizenship, and organized toward the effective utilization of these natural gifts. This study has been conducted through descriptive and historical qualitative research methods, and the data have been obtained by means of historical scanning pattern and document analysis.}
