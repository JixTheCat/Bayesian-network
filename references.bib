  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;This work seeks to synthesise the knowledge on the use of cover crops in vineyards in the last 20 years, emphasising on the one hand, soil characteristics such as nutrition, organic carbon, structure or erosion and, on the other hand, environmental factors such as soil and biodiversity in vineyards, and gas emissions.\&lt;br /\&gt;A systematic review was made using Scopus-index journals for the past 20 years (1999 - 2018). The selection was independently done by two researchers, selecting a total of 272 published papers related to cover crops in the vineyard. Each article was categorised according to its theme and metadata were created, considering all relevant information from an agro-ecological point of view.\&lt;br /\&gt;The use of cover crops has a positive effect on the vineyard by increasing soil organic carbon (SOC), improving water infiltration and aggregate stability, and reducing erosion and greenhouse gases emission to the atmosphere. Furthermore, there is an increase in biodiversity, both in soil and the vineyard. Finally, cover crops do not constitute as a rule a major competition for nutrients to the vines except for nitrogen when grass covers are used. Contrarily, legume cover crops generally increase N in the soil, although its availability for plants is not immediate.\&lt;br /\&gt;This review constitutes an objective tool to help growers when considering the use of cover crops in vineyards that, based in a systematic review, provides relevant information depending on the characteristics of the growing condition of the vineyard.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  abstract = {We propose here a decision support system for vine growers to assess the quality of a vineyard to be planted. The quality of a vineyard is defined by the probability of possible profitability of the wine sales he is able to produce. The model, based on a Bayesian network (BN), takes into account environment and the parameters defining vineyard status with their associated interactions. BN are widely used for knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty in natural resource management. There is a rising interest in BN as tools for ecological and agronomic modelling. Data were collected from knowledge of vine-growing experts. We developed a C\# computer program predicting the likely quality of a vineyard. The model has been validated on existing vineyards with prediction ability around 75~\%. This system should ease assessments of the likely impact of the choices and decisions of vine growers on the quality of new vineyards to be planted in any part of the world. No such model has been developed before for vine growers.},

This paper reviews the scientific literature on the impacts of climate change on yield variance and investigates their implications for the demand of crop insurance and effectiveness of different farm strategies and policy measures using crop farm data in Australia, Canada and Spain. A microeconomic farm level model is calibrated to different types of farms and used to simulate the responses and impacts of four policy measures: ex post disaster payments and three types of crop insurance (individual yields, area-based yield and weather index). The strong uncertainties about climate change are captured in a set of seven scenarios covering different assumptions about the scope of climate change (no change, marginal change, and high occurrence of extreme events), and farmers' adaptation response (no adaptation, diversification, and structural adaptation). Policy decision making under these uncertainties is analysed using a standard Bayesian probabilistic approach, but also using other criteria that look for robust second best choices (MaxiMin and Satisficing criteria).},

  abstract = {Drought is one of the most challenging natural phenomena and occurs due to inadequate and erratic precipitation (snowfall and rainfall) as well as the effects of high temperature on agronomical and horticultural crops. Among horticultural crops, grapes suffer extensively from inadequate berry formation due to drought. Therefore, developing a comprehensive drought monitoring tool with a drought assessment system that incorporates multiple agrometeorological variables into a single drought indicator is critical for supporting growers. In this context, the objective of this research was to assess drought severity using the composite drought index (CDI) and determine the variations in grape yields in drought-affected vineyards. In this study, the CDI was developed for the years 2016--2020 by comprising five indices: the vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), deviation of NDVI from the long-term mean (NDVI DEV), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and precipitation condition index (PCI). Moreover, the quantitative principal component analysis (PCA) approach was used to assign a weight for each input parameter, and then the weights of all the indices were combined into one composite drought index. Finally, Bayesian regularized artificial neural networks (BRANNs) were used to evaluate the yield variation in each affected vineyard. The results were validated with the standard precipitation index (SPI) from 2016 to 2020. Moderate to severe drought was detected with the CDI across Kabul Province during 2016 and 2018. The correlation coefficient between the CDI and SPI-1 in the active growth stages (April to October) was relatively high, at 0.64. A validation was performed with the correlating yield losses, and losses of 3.4 ton/ha and 4.7 ton/ha were found in 2016 and 2018, respectively, under severe drought conditions. The findings suggested that the CDI can be used for vineyard drought detections and agricultural organization support to more precisely aid farmers during severe drought conditions in grape-growing regions based on satellite remote sensing datasets. {$\bullet$}Composite Drought Index was developed to predict drought severity.{$\bullet$}Principal component analysis was used to assign a weight for vegetation indices.{$\bullet$}Standard precipitation Index was used for validation with local weather station for drought.{$\bullet$}Moderate to severe drought was detected with the CDI across Kabul Province during 2016 and 2018.{$\bullet$}Artificial neural networks were used to evaluate the yield variation in each affected vineyard.},

This review aimed to investigate sustainability along the entire wine chain, from primary production to the finished wine, with specific attention to three key dimensions of sustainability (environmental, social, and economic) and relating measures. Therefore, it was decided to: investigate the ways in which sustainability is applied in the various stages of the production chain (wine growing, wineries, distribution chain, and waste management); analyse the regulations in force throughout the world and the main labelling systems; provide numerical information on sustainable grapes and wines; study the objective quality of sustainable wines and that perceived by consumers, considering that it affects their willingness to pay. The research highlighted that rules and regulations on organic production of grapes and wines are flanked by several certification schemes and labelling systems. Although sustainable wines represent a niche in the market, in recent years, there has been an increase in vineyards conducted with sustainable (mainly organic and biodynamic) methods, and a consequent increase in the production of sustainable wines both in traditional and emerging producing countries. Although (or perhaps precisely for this reason) no significant differences in quality are found among sustainable and conventional wines, consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainably produced wines. This finding should encourage wineries to both put in place environmental activities and intensify their communication.},

This study examines New Zealand winegrowers in terms of their attitudes and behaviours towards wine tourism and sustainable wine production. A national survey was conducted at the end of 2015, which was the fourth such survey to be undertaken as part of a longitudinal study of wine tourism in New Zealand. This survey drew on issues of wine and biosecurity, climate change, and eco-labelling, as well as wine tourism. These issues were examined within the context of three key drivers of sustainability: the physical aspects of sustainable wine production, the internal drivers within wine businesses for the adoption of sustainable practices, and the external regulatory aspects that govern the adoption of sustainable wine production practices. The findings indicate that there were substantial concerns with the perceived value provided by both wine tourism and sustainable winegrowing practices. These concerns exist at both the firm level and with the governing bodies that are responsible for implementing sustainable winegrowing initiatives. Unless this perception of the value of sustainability within the New Zealand wine industry is altered in the future, it appears that there will continue to be an ongoing issue as to how sustainable winegrowing initiatives are implemented.},

  abstract = {Object oriented Bayesian networks have proven themselves useful in recent years. The idea of applying an object oriented approach to Bayesian networks has extended their scope to larger domains that can be divided into autonomous but interrelated entities. Object oriented Bayesian networks have been shown to be quite suitable for dynamic domains as well. However, processing object oriented Bayesian networks in practice does not take advantage of their modular structure. Normally, the object oriented Bayesian network is transformed into a Bayesian network, and inference is performed by constructing a junction tree from this network. In this paper we propose a method for translating directly from object oriented Bayesian networks to junction trees, avoiding the intermediate transformation. We pursue two main purposes: firstly, to maintain the original structure organized in an instance tree and secondly, to gain efficiency during modification of an object oriented Bayesian network. To accomplish these two goals we have exploited a mechanism allowing local triangulation of instances to develop a method for updating the junction trees associated with object oriented Bayesian networks in highly dynamic domains. The communication needed between instances is achieved by means of a fill-in propagation scheme.},

  abstract = {Purpose---knowing in advance vineyard yield is a critical success factor so growers and winemakers can achieve the best balance between vegetative and reproductive growth. It is also essential for planning and regulatory purposes at the regional level. Estimation errors are mainly due to the high inter-annual and spatial variability and inadequate or poor performance sampling methods; therefore, improved applied methodologies are needed at different spatial scales. This paper aims to identify the alternatives to traditional estimation methods. Design/methodology/approach---this study consists of a systematic literature review of academic articles indexed on four databases collected based on multiple query strings conducted on title, abstract, and keywords. The articles were reviewed based on the research topic, methodology, data requirements, practical application, and scale using PRISMA as a guideline. Findings---the methodological approaches for yield estimation based on indirect methods are primarily applicable at a small scale and can provide better estimates than the traditional manual sampling. Nevertheless, most of these approaches are still in the research domain and lack practical applicability in real vineyards by the actual farmers. They mainly depend on computer vision and image processing algorithms, data-driven models based on vegetation indices and pollen data, and on relating climate, soil, vegetation, and crop management variables that can support dynamic crop simulation models. Research limitations---this work is based on academic articles published before June 2021. Therefore, scientific outputs published after this date are not included. Originality/value---this study contributes to perceiving the approaches for estimating vineyard yield and identifying research gaps for future developments, and supporting a future research agenda on this topic. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first systematic literature review fully dedicated to vineyard yield estimation, prediction, and forecasting methods.},

  abstract = {Within ecological economics there is recognition of the need for new approaches to decision-making to support sustainable development initiatives. There is an increasing acknowledgement of the limitations of cost--benefit analysis approaches as a measure of the (un)sustainability of organizational activities. These are viewed as particularly inappropriate within the participatory settings that sustainable development proponents seek to foster. They also fail to deal with the highly contested nature of sustainable development discourse in contemporary pluralist democracies. While advances have been made in the field of multi-criteria decision-making, there is still a relative dearth of versatile models that accommodate monetization in a way that recognizes the limits of calculative technologies. This article introduces readers to developments within the accounting discipline designed to support sustainable development decision-making and evaluation. In particular, it proposes sustainability assessment models as a viable alternative to cost--benefit analysis. Sustainability assessment models are based on an inter-disciplinary approach that recognizes the need for ``accountings'' that facilitate more participatory forms of decision-making and accountability. As such, they address many of the weaknesses in current approaches to cost--benefit analysis. The authors' first experiences with sustainability assessment models were with BP and the United Kingdom oil and gas sector, where models were developed as a means of making previously external costs more central to organizational decision-making. Later work has included exploration of a range of decision-making situations in private and public sector organizations in both the United Kingdom and New Zealand. This has involved more explicit attention to plural values and issues of participation, dialogue and democracy.},

In the grape, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and C13-norisoprenoids are present either in a free volatile form, or bound to sugars and rendered non-volatile. Of the many terpenoids in grapes, only a relatively small number makes an important contribution to wine aroma. This review summarises new developments in understanding terpenoids, including the monoterpenes linalool, cis-rose oxide, 1,8-cineole and wine lactone; the sesquiterpene rotundone; and the C13-norisoprenoids ?-damascenone, ?-ionone, 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene and (E)-1-(2,3,6-trimethylphenyl)buta-1,3-diene. Their origin, formation and behaviour during winemaking and ageing, and viticultural influences on their concentration, will be discussed, as well as their role in different wine styles.},

  abstract = {This book presents a multidisciplinary collection of original contributions made by the leading scholars and practitioners on researching, building, and maintaining sustainable agricultural systems. Being the first of its kind, the book is divided into two volumes. This book presents a comprehensive and informed review of the current state of multidisciplinary knowledge on sustainability in agriculture. The gaps in the scholarly literature are identified and rigorously analyzed, presenting a clear picture of the promising research directions. The authors critically analyze the very concept of sustainable agricultural systems, primarily focusing on the interactions existing between their integral components and with external environments. Relying on the provisions of complex systems science, the scholars then discuss the best approaches and methodologies used to build a comprehensive understanding of agricultural systems, with relation to achieving and maintaining their sustainability. More than that, this book holds two rich sections on (1) agricultural economics and (2) rural sustainability. Understanding sustainable development as a movement toward clearly defined and measurable goals, a set of chapters explore those policies, practices, technologies, and management systems that have an impact on the sustainability of agricultural systems. Agricultural sustainability is an urgent issue to be addressed, and this book makes a unique contribution. Due to its practical focus, the book appeals to practitioners and policymakers working in agricultural economics, governance, and sustainability, not just academics. This is also a valuable resource for graduate students interested in agricultural systems, sustainability, as well as complex systems theory and practice.},

The compelling collection of chapters presents critical, comparative, and balanced perspectives on what changes are needed to achieve and maintain sustainability in agricultural systems, actively leading to new ways of thinking about these complex issues. The research presented relies on an array of methods developed within complex systems science, addresses the existing gaps in the scholarship, and uses original data collected on the development of agricultural systems. Finally, the authors provide robust conclusions and recommendations for both scholars and practitioners in the field of studying, constructing, and maintaining sustainable agricultural systems. The special focus of the book is on technologies, policies, and management systems enabling sustainable agricultural development. A rich collection of practical cases could be used to move from theories to reality. The book appeals to both academics and professionals working in the field. .},

Globally, particularly in Lithuania and other northern regions with similar climatic and soil conditions, there is a lack of data on the long-term effects of crop rotation under the current conditions of intensive farming and climate change. It has long been recognized that monocultures cause soil degradation compared to crop rotation. Research hypothesis: the long-term implementation of crop rotation makes a positive influence on the soil environment. The aim of our investigation was to compare the effects of a 50-year-long application of different crop rotations and monocultures on soil CO2 emissions, earthworms, and productivity of winter rye. Long-term stationary field experiments were established in 1966 at Vytautas Magnus University Experimental Station (54{$^\circ$}53{$\prime$} N, 23{$^\circ$}50{$\prime$} E). The study was conducted using intensive field rotation with row crops, green manure crop rotations, three-course rotation, and rye monoculture. Pre-crop had the largest impact on soil CO2 emissions, and more intensive soil CO2 emissions occurred at the beginning of winter rye growing season. Rye appeared not to be demanding in terms of pre-crops. However, its productivity decreased when grown in monoculture, and the optimal mineral fertilization remained lower than with crop rotation, but productivity remained stable.},

The extremely large extension of viticulture worldwide offers the possibility to evaluate the impacts of climate variability on many aspects of the grape growing system. For this, we initiated a global survey to retrieve the most important diseases and pests in many grape growing regions worldwide and to identify the risk of exposure to pests and diseases of viticulture as a function of climate.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p class=\&quot;Abstract\&quot;\&gt;\&lt;strong\&gt;Methods and results:\&lt;/strong\&gt; Based on the answer of respondent about the main reported diseases/pests in their region, a severity index was calculated. Each region was geolocalised and data were compared to the WorldClim gridded climate database to document the range of climate conditions (growing season temperature and rainfall) associated to the main diseases/pests. The potential climatic-induced changes of grapevine disease and pest geography by 2050 are assessed using agro-climate projections from the ARPEGE CNRM model, using the RCP 4.5 scenario. The preliminary results allow to determine the distribution of diseases as function of agroclimatic indicators.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;\&lt;strong\&gt;Conclusion:\&lt;/strong\&gt; While the distribution of diseases differs according to the region of the world, the current analysis suggests that mildews remain the major phytosanitary threat in most of the regions. Powdery mildew, trunk diseases and viruses were reported in extremely diverse climatic conditions, including intermediate and wet regions.~\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;\&lt;strong\&gt;Significance and impact of the study:\&lt;/strong\&gt; This paper present an original methodology to address the relationship between grapevine disease and pest occurrences and climate. Such documentation is scarce in the current literature. Further analysis is currently being performed, including additional survey answers, climate indices and supplementary data collected (spatial extension, frequency of treatments{\dots}) to better depict the challenges of grapevine phytosanitary management in a changing climate.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.}

  abstract = {Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction between yield levels of nonleguminous crops and soil organic matter (SOM) under the specific conditions of organic and conventional farming, respectively, and to identify implications for SOM management in arable farming considering the farming system (organic vs. conventional). For that purpose, correlations between yield levels of nonlegume crops and actual SOM level (Corg, Nt, Chwe, Nhwe) as well as SOM-level development were examined including primary data from selected treatments of seven long-term field experiments in Germany and Switzerland. Yield levels of nonlegume crops were positively correlated with SOM levels, but the correlation was significant only under conditions of organic farming, and not with conventional farming treatments. While absolute SOM levels had a positive impact on yield levels of nonlegumes, the yield levels of nonlegumes and SOM-level development over time correlated negatively. Due to an increased demand of N from SOM mineralization, higher yield levels of nonlegumes obviously indicate an increased demand for OM supply to maintain SOM levels. Since this observation is highly significant for farming without mineral-N fertilization but not for farming with such fertilization, we conclude that the demand of SOM-level maintenance or enhancement and thus adequate SOM management is highly relevant for crop production in organic farming both from an agronomical and ecological point of view. Under conventional management, the agronomic relevance of SOM with regard to nutrient supply is much lower than under organic management. However, it has to be considered that we excluded other possible benefits of SOM in our survey that may be highly relevant for conventional farming as well.},

  abstract = {This study presents an analysis of temperature and precipitation trends and their impact on grape harvests in the Pened{\`e}s region (NE Spain). It includes analyses of maximum, minimum and mean daily temperatures (for both the growing and ripening seasons) and daily rainfall (for the hydrological year, the growing season and each phenological stage) for three observatories in the immediate area. We analysed a series of factors: beginning and end harvest dates; the day on which a given potential alcoholic degree was reached; and yield for several varieties of grape grown in the area in relation to climatic variables. Maximum temperatures increased at all the observatories, with greater values being recorded in recent years (1996-2009) than in previous decades (1960s-2000s): we observed increases in average growing season temperatures of 0.11{$^\circ$}C per year for the period 1996-2009 vs 0.04{$^\circ$}C per year for the period 1960-2009 at Vilafranca del Pened{\`e}s. These temperature changes were due mainly to increases in maximum temperatures and an increase in the incidence of extreme heat (number of days with T{$>$}30{$^\circ$}C). Crop evapotranspiration also increased significantly during the same period. The Winkler index also increased, so the study area would correspond to region IV according to that climatic classification. There were no significant trends in annual rainfall but rainfall recorded between bloom and veraison decreased significantly at the three observatories, with the greatest decrease corresponding to the period 1996-2009. The dates on which harvests started and ended showed a continuous advance (of between -0.7 and -1.1~days per year, depending on the variety), which was significantly correlated with the average mean and maximum daily growing season temperatures (up to -7.68~days for 1{$^\circ$}C increase). Winegrape yield was influenced by the estimated water deficit (crop evapotranspiration minus precipitation) in the bloom-veraison period; this value increased due to a reduction in precipitation and an increase in evapotranspiration. Yield may have been reduced by up to 30~kg/ha for each millimetre increase in the estimated water deficit. Under these conditions, new strategies need to be followed in this area in order to maintain grape quality and yield.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Through changes in the climate, anthropogenic climate change has the potential to alter fire dynamics. Here we compile satellite (19 and 32 years) and ground-based (90 years) burned area datasets, climate and weather observations, and simulated fuel loads for Australian forests. Burned area in Australia's forests shows a linear positive annual trend but an exponential increase during autumn and winter. The mean number of years since the last fire has decreased consecutively in each of the past four decades, while the frequency of forest megafire years ({$>$}1 Mha burned) has markedly increased since 2000. The increase in forest burned area is consistent with increasingly more dangerous fire weather conditions, increased risk factors associated with pyroconvection, including fire-generated thunderstorms, and increased ignitions from dry lightning, all associated to varying degrees with anthropogenic climate change.}

  abstract = {Soil erosion is affected by rainfall temporal patterns and intensity variability. In vineyards, machine traffic is implemented with particular intensity from late spring to harvest, and it is responsible for soil compaction, which likely affects soil hydraulic properties, runoff, and soil erosion. Additionally, the hydraulic and physical properties of soil are highly influenced by vineyards\&rsquo; inter-rows soil management. The effects on soil compaction and both hydrological and erosional processes of machine traffic were investigated on a sloping vineyard with different inter-row soil managements (tillage and permanent grass cover) in the Alto Monferrato area (Piedmont, NW Italy). During the investigation (November 2016\&ndash;October 2018), soil water content, rainfall, runoff, and soil erosion were continuously monitored. Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil penetration resistance, and bulk density were recorded periodically in portions of inter-rows affected and not affected by the machine traffic. Very different yearly precipitation characterized the observed period, leading to higher bulk density and lower infiltration rates in the wetter year, especially in the tilled vineyard, whereas soil penetration resistance was generally higher in the grassed plot and in drier conditions. In the wet year, management with grass cover considerably reduced runoff (\&minus;76\%) and soil loss (\&minus;83\%) compared to tillage and in the dry season. Those results highlight the need to limit the tractor traffic, in order to reduce negative effects due to soil compaction, especially in tilled inter-rows.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development of a participatory decision support system for water management in the Upper Guadiana basin in central Spain where there has long been competition for groundwater resources between the agricultural sector and the environment. In the last few decades the rapid development of irrigation has led to the over-exploitation of the Mancha Occidental aquifer, the main water source in the area; this in turn has led to the loss of ecologically important wetlands. Against this background the River Basin Authority (RBA) has designed a new water management plan aimed at reducing water consumption. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of these measures on both the environment and the agricultural sector. To this end stakeholders have been invited to actively participate in the development of a decision support system (DSS) based on the combination of an agro-economic model and an object-oriented Bayesian network. This DSS has been used to evaluate the trade-off between agriculture and the environment for different management options at different scales. Results indicate that achieving even a partial recovery of the aquifer water levels will require strict enforcement by the RBA of water restrictions on farmers combined with a high offer price for the purchase of water rights. However, compliance with water restrictions inevitably leads to losses in farm income, especially in small vineyard farms, unless additional measures are taken to compensate for those potential losses. The purchase of water rights alone is insufficient to ensure the recovery of water levels; accompanying measures included in the new regional management plan will also need to be undertaken.},

  abstract = {Viticulture is gradually shifting to more sustainable production systems and a fair number of studies aim at assessing the environmental impacts of different technologies and techniques adopted in the wine production through the Life Cycle Assessment approach. The main environmental issues identified are on water, soil and energy use, management of organic and inorganic solid waste streams, greenhouse gas emissions and use of chemicals. Precision viticulture (PV) techniques can play an important role in the sustainable use of water and fertilizers in grape production, thanks to the site-specific application of these inputs, improving yield and quality of grapes while minimizing negative effects on the environment. However, PV often implies investments and additional management costs. The objective of this study is to compare different strategies for the management of water and fertilizers in vineyards, ranging from the conventional ones to the most technologically advanced, to assess their sustainability both from an economic and an environmental point of view. Six scenarios have been explored, considering different irrigation water supply systems, and irrigation and fertilizer management strategies. A multidisciplinary approach, including Life Cycle Assessment, economic assessment and multivariate analysis was used to assess the sustainability of the different vineyard management approaches. The results show the higher economic and environmental sustainability for the scenario considering irrigation water supplied from an irrigation consortium, a variable rate drip irrigation system for irrigation and fertigation. Finally, also according to PCA results, at least for the scenarios explored in the study, the introduction of PV technologies led to the reduction of environmental impacts and to the increase in economic advantages, which showed to be inversely correlated.},

  abstract = {{$\bullet$}Transfer learning for the grape detection in images.{$\bullet$}Impact of data augmentation on the accuracy of grape images segmentation.{$\bullet$}Evaluation in 3 feature spaces: color and texture, texture only, and color only. Convolutional neural networks, as a type of deep learning approach, have revolutionized the field of computer vision and pattern recognition through state of the art performance in a large number of classification tasks. Machine learning has been recently incorporated into intelligent systems related to agricultural and food production to decrease manual processing when dealing with large number of operations. Feedforward artificial neural networks such as convolutional neural networks can be used in agriculture for the segmentation and classification of images containing objects of interests such as fruits, or leaves. It is however unknown what is the best architecture to use, if it is necessary to propose new architectures, and what is the impact of the input feature space on the classification performance. In this paper, we propose to detect two types of grapes (Albari{\~n}o white grapes and Barbera red grapes) in images. We investigate 1) the impact of the input feature space: color images, grayscale images, and color histograms using convolutional neural networks; 2) the impact of the parameters such as the size of the blocks, and the impact of data augmentation; 3) the performance of 11 pre-trained deep learning architectures, i.e. using a transfer learning approach for the classification. The results support the conclusion that images of grapes can be efficiently segmented using different feature spaces where color images provide the best performance. With convolutional neural networks using transfer learning, the best performance is achieved with Resnet networks reaching an accuracy of 99\% for both red and white grapes. Finally, data augmentation, image normalization, and the input feature space have a key impact on the overall performance.},

  abstract = {The estimation of parameters for nonlinear process models is often accomplished through optimization routines that search for a global optimum with respect to a least squares or weighted least squares criterion. While such an approach is often reasonable, it fails to account for all of the information that is available from the data and practitioner. Here we focus on the inclusion of prior knowledge in the estimation of parameters in nonlinear dynamic systems. We use the Bayesian paradigm to define the probability distribution over process model parameters, called the Bayesian posterior. The quantities associated with this posterior distribution (e.g., credible regions, means, modes) are estimated via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. We first give a short introduction to Bayesian parameter estimation and the role of MCMC in evaluating arbitrary probability distributions. Bayesian parameter estimation (via MCMC) is then applied to three case studies. The first case study shows the basic methodology of assigning and evaluating a Bayesian posterior to a simple problem that consists of estimating the mean and variance of a sample. The second case study uses prior information that specifies a preference for a particular type of reaction mechanism over another for a simulated fermentation system; the inclusion of such prior information is shown to improve the estimated values of the model parameters in situations where data are sparse or noisy (compared to the more common weighted least squares approach). The third case study develops a hybrid semi-parametric neural network (NN) model to predict time-dependent observed state variables (cell and protein concentration) in Escherichia coli fermentations. An integral step in the development of this hybrid model is parameter estimation of a nonlinear dynamic model. A hybrid model developed from the Bayesian parameter estimates is shown to outperform a hybrid model developed from the weighted least squares parameter estimates for predicting the final protein yield of a test set. {\copyright} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2006},

This results in modifications of agricultural practices such as the application of organic manure, the use of tillage or grass-cutting to control weeds and the application of natural pesticides with preventive action. One of the aims of organic farming is to preserve the environment. In this context, the objective of our work was to evaluate the long-term effects of organic viticulture on soil quality. The study was conducted in a commercial vineyard where plots which had been organically managed for 7 (Organic7), 11 (Organic11) and 17 years (Organic17) were compared to conventionally managed plots (Conventional). Soil physical and chemical parameters (bulk density, organic matter, available phosphorus, potassium and copper contents) and biological parameters (soil microbial biomass, density of nematode trophic groups and density and biomass of earthworm ecological categories) were measured. The organic farming led to an increase in soil organic matter, potassium content, soil microbial biomass, plant-feeding and fungal-feeding nematode densities. However, organic farming increased soil compaction, decreased endogeic earthworm density and did not modify the soil micro-food web evaluated by nematofauna analysis. Our study highlights the difficulty to show the benefits of organic farming on global soil quality in this particular pedoclimatic area and set of farming practices.},

The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of cluster thinning on the wine quality of Syrah cultivar under Mediterranean climate. Particular attention has been given to the volatile aroma compounds which are determinant for the sensory quality of the wine. Manual cluster thinning in the early stage of veraison was applied and compared with a not thinned control. Cluster thinning influenced yield reduction, advanced grape maturity, improved the phenolic content of grapes and therefore of wine, and influenced the volatile profile of wine. The grapes of thinned plants tend to get rich in varietal and fermentation aromas. Despite the economic impact, cluster thinning is a viable option due to the improvement in wine quality, especially for increasing the amount of compounds responsible for the typical aroma and color, at least in the Mediterranean climate where the search was carried out.},

Unfortunately, however, the varied design of the sustainability initiatives and the differences in the objectives, methodologies, and proposed tools risks to create confusion, and undermine the positive aspects of these initiatives. In order to bring some clarity to this topic, we herein present a comparison of the most important sustainability programs in the Italian wine sector, with the overall objective of highlighting the opportunity to create synergies between the initiatives and define a common sustainability strategy for the Italian wine sector.},

  abstract = {Remote-sensing measurements are crucial for smart-farming applications, crop monitoring, and yield forecasting, especially in fields characterized by high heterogeneity. Therefore, in this study, Precision Viticulture (PV) methods using proximal- and remote-sensing technologies were exploited and compared in a table grape vineyard to monitor and evaluate the spatial variation of selected vegetation indices and biophysical variables throughout selected phenological stages (multi-seasonal data), from veraison to harvest. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Normalized Difference Red-Edge Index were calculated by utilizing satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) and proximal sensing (active crop canopy sensor Crop Circle ACS-470) to assess the correlation between the outputs of the different sensing methods. Moreover, numerous vegetation indices and vegetation biophysical variables (VBVs), such as the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, the Normalized Difference Water Index, the Fraction of Vegetation Cover, and the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, were calculated, using the satellite data. The vegetation indices analysis revealed different degrees of correlation when using diverse sensing methods, various measurement dates, and different parts of the cultivation. The results revealed the usefulness of proximal- and remote-sensing-derived vegetation indices and variables and especially of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation in the monitoring of vineyard condition and yield examining, since they were demonstrated to have a very high degree of correlation (coefficient of determination was 0.87). The adequate correlation of the vegetation indices with the yield during the latter part of the veraison stage provides valuable information for the future estimation of production in broader areas.},

  abstract = {Cover crops could provide many interesting environmental services for vineyards, but French Mediterranean winegrowers mostly avoid permanent cover cropping because they fear too much competition and consequently a reduction in grapevine yield. To better understand the effect of cover cropping management on vine growth and yield, we carried out our study in a vineyard of Shiraz (Vitis vinifera L.) in the Mediterranean region of France over three consecutive years. Three cover crop strategies were monitored (30CC, 60CC and 100CC corresponding respectively to 30\%, 60\% and 100\% of cover crop soil coverage) on two types of soils (shallow and deep), and compared with bare soil (0CC corresponding to 0\% cover crop, controlled with chemical weeding). Grapevine growth, yield and soil moisture were measured and the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) was simulated using a water balance model. Grapevine yields decreased as the cover crop soil coverage increased, and these yield reductions were found to be more severe in the shallow soil. Nevertheless, the 30CC treatment appeared to be both feasible and useful for ecosystem services such as soil protection whatever the soil depth. Moreover, FTSW was found to be relevant as an early yield indicator that could be useful to adapt the cover crop strategy to seasonal climate characteristics. The findings support the feasibility of a cover crop-based strategy, even in the Mediterranean region, as an effective measure to reduce the use of herbicides and fossil fuels without significantly decreasing the grape yield, provided that the winegrowers adapt their strategy to the soil depth and to the seasonal climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {Despite attention to sustainability growing in the last decade in the wine sector, the rate of association with wine sustainability programs still appears to be limited. This is mainly related to the uncertainty about the economic benefits related to the implementation of sustainable best practices. In this regard, some studies highlighted that the presence of professionals capable of managing the requirements promoted by the standards generally leads to a positive perception of their impact on the economic performances of companies. Therefore, to encourage participation in sustainability programs, the adoption of a collaborative approach to share the skills and knowledge necessary to manage the transition from a conventional organization to a sustainable one seems to be a functional strategy. This paper presents the Prosecco Sustainability Project as a case study to investigate how a structured set of activities must be deployed through a participatory/collaborative approach to significantly improve the level of sustainability of a wide and heterogeneous community of grape and wine producers. The case study highlights that the collaboration between different actors and the guidance from a coordinating figure capable of fostering dialogue and cooperation among the various stakeholders represent key elements to the large-scale deployment of a sustainable management system.},

New Zealand has experienced a winery boom over the past two decades with a 173 per cent increase in the number of wineries. Along with this growth, wineries are also facing issues such as water consumption, its impact on community, and waste management. The study therefore seeks to examine: the current sustainability initiatives undertaken by wineries; what drives the wine industry to engage in sustainable practices; and barriers to implementing sustainable practices. Design/methodology/approach Using a mixed method research approach, this study uses a triangulated approach to examine interviews and questionnaires to determine motivations and elements of influence. Findings This study found that the strong drivers for the sustainability initiatives are their concern about the state of the environment and social responsibility, followed by requirements for exporting and protection of agricultural land. Research limitations/implications A limitation of this study was a low response rate from the online questionnaire, which may influence or bias study results. However, detailed face-to-face interviews help to gain clarification on concepts and study results. Practical implications While global wine consumption is growing, environmental sustainability in the wine industry is also receiving increasing attention from retailers, governments, environmental groups and consumers. New Zealand has experienced a winery boom over the past two decades with a 173 per cent increase in the number of wineries. Along with this growth, wineries are also facing issues such as water consumption, its impact on community, and waste management. Originality/value Although there are many studies about the wine industry, relatively few studies have examined sustainability elements from a mixed-method approach to determine practical elements which may influence practices undertaken. It also examines practices undertaken by wineries, barriers to implementation and incentives to further implementation.}

  abstract = {Global warming (GW) refers to the gradual increase in Earth's average surface temperature caused by human activities. This phenomenon has far-reaching consequences that affect the environment, society, and economy and has created a multitude of challenges for the wine industry, affecting grape cultivation, wine production, aging, and quality management. To analyze the negative impact of GW on the wine industry and to examine the equilibrium that maximizes welfare and profit in the face of climate change. A mathematical model that considers the various stages of wine production to examine the wine industry's equilibrium that maximizes welfare and profit. Global warming impacts the wine industry's equilibrium, causing measurable distortions and an inefficient market solution. However, our analysis also indicates that adaptation to GW is possible by adopting and adjusting new agricultural practices. Our findings suggest that GW has a notable negative impact on the wine industry. Winemakers should consider adapting their agricultural practices. In addition, policymakers need to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change on the wine industry. Policymakers should promote the adoption of renewable energy sources and sustainable farming practices in the wine industry and provide financial incentives and regulatory support to maximize welfare.}

  abstract = {Although transit buses have a relatively small impact on greenhouse gas emissions, they have a larger impact on urban air quality, have commercially available electric models, and have historically commercialized clean technologies that enabled deployment in other heavy-duty vehicles. This paper investigates what factors affect transit agencies' decisions to go beyond electric bus pilots to larger scale deployments, with the goal of identifying strategies to enable an accelerated transition to an electrified fleet. This mixed methods analysis utilized quantitative total cost of ownership analysis and qualitative interviews to study the barriers and drivers of electric bus investment for transit fleets in three case study states: California, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. A total cost of ownership analysis estimated electric buses are already more cost-effective than diesel buses in many agency contexts, but are sensitive to key parameters such as annual mileage, fossil fuel costs, and electricity tariffs and supporting policies that vary widely. Though multiple agencies in California reported planning to fully electrify their fleets, outside California where less supportive policies exist, fewer agencies reported planning to procure additional electric buses, primarily owing to high first cost and undesirable tradeoffs with maintaining transit service levels. Interview respondents also reported other substantial barriers such as oversubscribed grant programs, charging infrastructure costs, electricity costs, and additional operational complexity, suggesting a need for multiple complementary policies to overcome these barriers and ensure agencies can transition to a new technology without affecting transit service.}

It is generally accepted that hydrological processes and, subsequently, soil erosion rates are usually different between cultivated and abandoned soils. However, these alterations are still poorly studied in relation to the general weather conditions in vineyards and abandoned vineyards. Thus, the main goals of this research are to (1) estimate the differences in soil properties, (2) quantify water and soil losses due to rainfall and specific soil management practices, and (3) analyze which kind of weather type and rainfall event is able to generate specific surface flows and soil loss rates. To achieve these goals, we focused on the specific case of the sloping vineyards of the Montes de M{\'a}laga (South Spain). We used 4 paired-erosion plots with Gerlach troughs to quantify soil loss and surface flow and conducted an analysis of the weather conditions during each rainfall event. The weather types that generated the highest amount of rainfall in the studied area came from the western (32.6}

The objective of this work is to estimate and compare the impacts of croplands and vineyards under conventional management croplands and vineyards on soil properties (water holding capacity---WHC; bulk density---BD; soil water content---SWC; water stable aggregates---WSA; mean weight diameter---MWD; soil organic matter---SOM; available phosphorus---AP; total nitrogen---TN) and hydrological response (runoff---Run; sediment content---SC; sediment loss---SL; carbon loss---C loss; phosphorus loss---P loss; nitrogen loss---N loss) in Eastern Croatia. To achieve these goals, a study was set up using rainfall simulation tests at 58\,mm\,h-1 over 30\,minutes on 2 locations (Zmajevac: 45{$^\circ$}48{$\prime$}N; 18{$^\circ$}46{$\prime$}E; Erdut: 45{$^\circ$}30{$\prime$}N; 19{$^\circ$}01{$\prime$}E). In total, 32 rainfall simulations were carried out, 8 repetitions in vineyards and 8 in cropland plots of 0.876\,m2, per location. Bulk density was significantly higher in cropland plots compared with the vineyard. Soil water content was significantly higher in Zmajevac cropland compared with Erdut plots. Also, SWC was significantly lower in Zmajevac vineyard than in the cropland located in the same area. Water stable aggregates and MWD were significantly higher in vineyard plots than in the cropland. Also, SOM and TN were significantly lower in Zmajevac cropland compared with the vineyard located in the same area. Available phosphorus was significantly high in Zmajevac plots than in Erdut. The rainfall simulations showed that Run was significantly higher in Erdut vineyard (8.2\,L\,m-2) compared with Zmajevac (3.8\,L\,m-2). Also, the Run in Erdut Cropland was significantly lower than in the vineyard. Sediment content did not show significant differences among locations. In Erdut, vineyard plots had a significantly lower SL (28.0\,g\,m-2) than the cropland ones (39.1\,g\,m-2). C loss was significantly higher in Zmajevac cropland than in Erdut. Also, C loss was significantly lower in Zmajevac vineyard compared with the cropland. We did not observe significant differences in P loss, and N loss also did not show significant differences. The principal component analysis showed that SOM was associated with WSA, AP, and TN. These variables were negatively related to slope, SWC, and C loss (factor 1). Also, MWD was inversely related to SL, P, and N loss (factor 2). Bulk density and SC were negatively related to Run.

Summer and autumn are critical seasons for soil degradation due to the high-intensity, short-duration storms. Vineyards are vulnerable, especially on steep slopes. The particular effects of storms over the years under different soil conditions due to different management practices are not frequently addressed in the literature. The aim of this study was to examine the differences between runoff and soil moisture patterns influenced by 2 treatments: traditional tillage (Till) and a permanent cover crop. A shallow-rooted grass species Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. with considerable density coverage was selected as cover crop. This annual species was seeded once in the first year and then allowed to self-seed the following years. Tillage was performed at least twice in spring to a 10- to 15-cm depth and once in late autumn at a depth of 20 to 35\,cm. Rainfall simulation experiments were performed, 1 year after treatments, using high-intensity rainfall on closed plots of 2 m2, located in the middle strips of the vineyard with different treatments. The effects of simulated rainfall experiments were determined in 3 different moments of the growth cycle of cultivar: (1) in summer with dry soils, (2) in early autumn with moderate soil moisture, and (3) in autumn with wet soils. During the 2-year trial, the soil moisture level in the soil upper layer (0-10\,cm) was higher for Till treatment (14.1}

The limitations of qualitative methods such as GLASOD, errors and inaccuracies inherent in modelling based on small-scale plot experiments, and problems with 137Cs approaches, mean that alternative strategies are required. For runoff-related erosion on arable land we propose the use of a well-tried estimation technique: volumetric measurement of rills, gullies and fans. Amounts of wash and interrill erosion can also be estimated. This approach allows for the estimation of erosion rates at the field scale, rather than relying on extrapolations from plot-based data. Measurements are based on sampling the population of rills and gullies and can be adapted to the aims of the project for `broad-brush' or detailed data. Monitoring of large areas to produce regional assessments of erosion risk is frequently required and volumetric estimates provide these data. Thus predictions of the extent, frequency and amounts of erosion can be made and the vulnerability of particular crops becomes clear.}

  abstract = {The application of machine learning to agriculture is currently experiencing a ``surge of interest'' from the academic community as well as practitioners from industry. This increased attention has produced a number of differing approaches that use varying machine learning frameworks. It is arguable that Bayesian Networks are particularly suited to agricultural research due to their ability to reason with incomplete information and incorporate new information. Bayesian Networks are currently underrepresented in the machine learning applied to agriculture research literature, and to date there are no survey papers that currently centralize the state of the art. The aim of this paper is rectify the lack of a survey paper in this area by providing a self-contained resource that will: centralize the current state of the art, document the historical progression of Bayesian Networks in agriculture and indicate possible future lines of research as well as providing an introduction to Bayesian Networks for researchers who are new to the area.},

  abstract = {Using a survey of the public (n~=~2032) and broadacre farmers (n~=~351) in South Australia and Victoria, Australia, this research compares public and farmers' concerns regarding the acceptability and sustainability of agricultural operations. A principal component analysis was conducted on survey responses to 15 statements capturing environmental, social and governance issues related to agriculture practices and perceptions. This analysis revealed three dimensions: (1) issues related to animal welfare, greenhouse gas emissions and food safety; (2) issues related to farm input use; and (3) the use of socially valuable assets for private profits. Compared to farmers, the public were more concerned about the undersupply of public goods (e.g., farm animal welfare), and issues related to farm input use such as the use of synthetic fertilisers and chemicals. The public and farmers reported a similar level of concern regarding the use of socially valuable assets for private profit (e.g., irrigation water extraction). Regression analyses revealed associations between concerns and socio-demographic characteristics; environmental attitudes; sources of information; and farm characteristics. This study can act as a catalyst for developing practical strategies to analyse and overcome the issues, rather than symptoms, of concern affecting the agricultural industry and its sustainability. {$\bullet$}Public and farmer concerns about 15 agriculture-related issues were compared.{$\bullet$}The public were concerned about animal welfare, GHG emissions, food safety and input use.{$\bullet$}The public and farmers had similar concerns for use of socially valuable assets.{$\bullet$}Concerns vary with farm type, information source, attitudes, and demographics.{$\bullet$}Results do not support a rural-urban divide of concerns.},

  abstract = {Responsible management competences are the skills of managers to deal with the triple bottom line, stakeholder value and moral dilemmas. In this paper, we analyse how managers develop responsible management competences and how the competences interact with capabilities at the organisational level. The paper contributes to the responsible management literature by integrating research on absorptive capacity and organisational learning. By creating intersections between these disparate research streams, this study enables a better understanding of the development of responsible management competences. The paper is a systematic literature review on environmental competences, which are a type of responsible management competences referring to the managerial skills aimed at improving environmental sustainability. The findings demonstrate that managers who are able to recognize and acquire external knowledge develop environmental competences, and organisations capable of assimilating, transforming and exploiting knowledge develop environmental capabilities. The paper establishes that a dynamic and recursive relation exists between environmental competences and capabilities. Antecedents and contextual conditions specific to a sustainability context, such as eco-centric values and stakeholder pressures, influence the development of environmental competences. The study shows that environmental competences have a positive direct effect on environmental performance, and an indirect effect as a mediator between environmental capabilities and performance.}

  abstract = {Background and aims: Seasonal differences in vine yield need to be managed to ensure appropriate fruit composition at harvest. Differences in yield are the result of changes in vine management (e.g., the number of nodes retained after harvest) and weather conditions (in particular, temperature) at key vine development stages. Early yield prediction enables growers to manage vines to achieve target yields and prepare the required infrastructure for the harvest. Methods and results: Bunch mass data was collected during the 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons from a commercial vineyard on the Wairau Plains, Marlborough, New Zealand (41 degrees 2'23 '' S; 173 degrees 51'15 '' E). A Bayesian growth model, assuming a double sigmoidal curve, was used to predict the yield at the end of each season. The accuracy of the prediction was investigated using the Monte-Carlo simulation for yield prediction at various growth stages assuming different prior information. Conclusion: The results show that the model is sensitive to prior assumption and that having a non-informative prior may be more beneficial than having an informative prior based on one unusual year.},

  abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a powerful tool that allows evaluation of the environmental performances of a product, service or process considering the whole life cycle or a part of it. In the wine sector, the application of LCA has grown significantly in recent years and several studies have been carried out about this topic that are similar to other research fields. Nowadays, LCA is an important and acknowledged environmental assessment tool but its application to the wine sector is still in a developing phase. For this reason, the present study proposes a critical review of papers dealing with both the wine sector and LCA. The critical review points out that the main wine hotspots are the viticulture phase (mainly due to fuel, fertilizer and pesticides consumption) and the wine primary packaging production (due to glass bottles). Furthermore, the papers taken into consideration have a wide variability in the system boundaries definition as well as a shortage of availability of original and site-specific inventory data. Such key factors are sensitive aspects that have a huge influence on the results of a study and they are also affected by a wide variability: these issues need further scientific contribution through future studies.},

However, many different measures have been defined in the literature with the aim of making better choices in general or for a specific application area. Choices made by one metric are claimed to be different from choices made by other metrics. In this work, we analyse experimentally the behaviour of 18 different performance metrics in several scenarios, identifying clusters and relationships between measures. We also perform a sensitivity analysis for all of them in terms of several traits: class threshold choice, separability/ranking quality, calibration performance and sensitivity to changes in prior class distribution. From the definitions and experiments, we make a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between metrics, and a taxonomy and arrangement of them according to the previous traits. This can be useful for choosing the most adequate measure (or set of measures) for a specific application. Additionally, the study also highlights some niches in which new measures might be defined and also shows that some supposedly innovative measures make the same choices (or almost) as existing ones. Finally, this work can also be used as a reference for comparing experimental results in pattern recognition and machine learning literature, when using different measures.},

  abstract = {Alto Douro Wine Region is located in the Northeast of Portugal and is classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Snaked by the Douro River, the region has been producing wines for over 2000~years, with the world-famous Porto wine standing out. The vineyards, in that region, are built in a territory marked by steep slopes and the almost inexistence of flat land and water. The vineyards that cover the great slopes rise from the Douro River and form an immense terraced staircase. All these ingredients combined make the right key for exploring precision agriculture techniques. In this study, a preliminary approach allowing to perform terrace vineyards identification is presented. This is a key-enabling task towards the achievement of important goals such as production estimation and multi-temporal crop evaluation. The proposed methodology consists in the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify and segment the terrace vineyards, considering a high-resolution dataset acquired with remote sensing sensors mounted in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).},

  abstract = {The scarcity of water due to climate change is endangering worldwide the production, quality, and economic viability of growing wine grapes. One of the main mitigation measures to be adopted in the viticulture sector will be an adequate irrigation strategy. Irrigation involves an increasing demand for water, a natural limited resource with increasing availability problems for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the development of a precision irrigation system, which is able to manage the efficient use of water and to monitor the crop water stress, is an important research topic for viticulture. This paper, through the analysis of a case study, aims to describe the prototype of a software platform that integrates data coming from different innovative remote and proximal sensors to monitor the hydric stress status of the vineyard. In addition, by using a cost analysis of grape cultivation and implementing economic indices, this study examines the conditions by which irrigation strategies may be economically justified, helping the decision-making process. By combining different sensors, the platform makes it possible to assess the spatial and temporal variability of water in vineyards. In addition, the output data of the platforming, matched with the economic indices, support the decision-making process for winemakers to optimize and schedule water use under water-scarce conditions.},

  abstract = {Sustainability is a paradigm that affects many sectors due to an increasing of stakeholders' pressure, economic or political reasons. The wine industry is concerned about sustainability in both senses: it confronts threats from sustainability issues, such as climate change, chemical exposure and water and energy availability and its activities have their own impacts. In this sense, understanding sustainability in the wine world requires identifying definitions and principles, but also a review of current practices. This paper sets forth a cross-country analysis about current sustainability assessment frameworks in six countries (South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, US, Chile and France) in order to identify their main aspects, drivers and issues. A cross-analysis discusses the presentation, the scale, the scope, the governance, the deepness, the learning potential and the content, in a cross-disciplinary perspective. The common grounds are summarized in terms of main indicators linked with official guidelines. Most of the frameworks are certifications or labels in voluntary programs, using a qualitative approach to check compliance with guidelines, without proposing the improvement of sustainability performance. They are more focused on operation and on mitigating impact. All frameworks have indicators considering the main environmental issues to the wine industry. The frameworks development should move toward a more effective proposition for improving wine sustainability, in order to answer to the operational challenges with a strategic thinking. The analysis performed can contribute to the development of sustainability programs, improve current methods and encourage the diffusion of sustainability practices to the individuals or in terms of national programs.},

  abstract = {[Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.]}

This study examines climate change innovations in two regional wine clusters in Australia. In South Australia, the evidence suggests firms in the wine industry are implementing climate change innovations at a higher rate than their counterparts in Western Australia. To help explain these differences, key variables are examined. Knowledge exchanges in the region and firm-level absorptive capacity explain the uptake of climate change innovations in South Australian firms, whereas knowledge exchanges alone explain innovations in Western Australian firms. Conclusions are presented along with limitations and future research opportunities.},

  abstract = {Image and video tools for analyzing crop scenes and plants are essential for applying precision agriculture to crop maintenance, harvesting, or pruning. In this paper, we are interested in vine pruning, a task that requires a precise understanding of the vine structure with branch type identification, orientations, and node locations. However, estimating such a structure is highly challenging, given the large variety in grapevine appearances, lighting conditions, viewpoint, the interweaving of branches, occlusions, and the level of details needed. To address these challenges, we propose ViNet: a deep-learning approach for estimating the structure of grapevine, which comprises two main steps: The first one detects nodes and identifies the branch types of the plant, as well as the spatial relation between them, whilst the second one uses the extracted nodes and branches to build a graph, out of which the structure of the grapevine is inferred. In doing so, we make four main contributions: (i) we put forward for the first time a method for automatic segmentation and extraction of the grapevine structure from images; (ii) we propose a novel approach leveraging the powerful stacked hourglass network to infer node location, branch types and the spatial relationships between them; (iii) we propose a novel shortest path weighted graph optimization step to extract connections between nodes and infer the structure, allowing to address the problem of having an unknown number of branches in the tree; (iv) we publicly release a dataset of more than 1500 grapevine images fully annotated with the structure information. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate the efficiency of our approach at predicting the structure of a grapevine, achieving a precision and recall for node prediction of 95\% and 90\%, respectively, as well as ablation studies validating our design choices. {$\bullet$}Deep learning-based computer vision for viticulture{$\bullet$}Grapevine nodes, branches, and spatial relationships are estimated from a CNN{$\bullet$}Plant structure is recovered using a graph and Dijkstra algorithm{$\bullet$}A grapevine single Guyot dataset is publicly released},

  abstract = {One factor of precision agriculture is remote sensing, through which we can monitor vegetation health and condition. Much research has been conducted in the field of remote sensing and agriculture analyzing the applications, while the reviews gather the research on this field and examine different scientific methodologies. This work aims to gather the existing vegetation indices used in viticulture, which were calculated from imagery acquired by remote sensing platforms such as satellites, airplanes and UAVs. In this review we present the vegetation indices, the applications of these and the spatial distribution of the research on viticulture from the early 2000s. A total of 143 publications on viticulture were reviewed; 113 of them had used remote sensing methods to calculate vegetation indices, while the rejected ones have used proximal sensing methods. The findings show that the most used vegetation index is NDVI, while the most frequently appearing applications are monitoring and estimating vines water stress and delineation of management zones. More than half of the publications use multitemporal analysis and UAVs as the most used among remote sensing platforms. Spain and Italy are the countries with the most publications on viticulture with one-third of the publications referring to regional scale whereas the others to site-specific/vineyard scale. This paper reviews more than 90 vegetation indices that are used in viticulture in various applications and research topics, and categorized them depending on their application and the spectral bands that they are using. To summarize, this review is a guide for the applications of remote sensing and vegetation indices in precision viticulture and vineyard assessment.},

  abstract = {The direct effect of global warming on viticulture is already apparent, with unexpected pests and diseases as one of the most concerning consequences. Deploying sticky traps on grape plantations to attract key insects has been the backbone of conventional pest management programs. However, they are time-consuming processes for winegrowers, conducted through visual inspection via the manual identification and counting of key insects. Additionally, winegrowers usually lack taxonomy expertise for accurate species identification. This paper explores the usage of deep learning on the edge to identify and quantify pest counts automatically. Different mobile devices were used to acquire a dataset of yellow sticky and delta traps, consisting of 168 images with 8966 key insects manually annotated by experienced taxonomy specialists. Five different deep learning models suitable to run locally on mobile devices were selected, trained, and benchmarked to detect five different insect species. Model-centric, data-centric, and deployment-centric strategies were explored to improve and fine-tune the considered models, where they were tested on low-end and high-end mobile devices. The SSD ResNet50 model proved to be the most suitable architecture for deployment on edge devices, with accuracies per class ranging from 82\% to 99\%, the F1 score ranging from 58\% to 84\%, and inference speeds per trap image of 19.4 s and 62.7 s for high-end and low-end smartphones, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of the approach proposed to be integrated into a mobile-based solution for vineyard pest monitoring by providing automated detection and the counting of key vector insects to winegrowers and taxonomy specialists.},

  abstract = {Organic farming has undergone significant expansion in Europe over the last decade and it is often seen as a sustainable alternative to intensive agricultural systems. If it is to be truly sustainable, it must maintain levels of soil fertility sufficient for economic crop production in the long-term, whilst also protecting the environment. This paper presents results comparing soils managed organically for at least 15 years, with soils under conventional management, on four arable farms in England. There were no significant differences in total soil organic matter, total nitrogen or C:N ratio between the conventionally and organically managed soils. However, concentrations of extractable potassium and phosphorus were significantly lower in soils managed organically. The largest difference between the conventional and organic fields in potassium concentration was on the oldest organic farm. These results support the argument that organic mixed arable systems are mining reserves of potassium and phosphorus, built up during conventional management, and that changes to organic management practices to increase inputs of potassium and phosphorus are required, if long-term declines in soil fertility, and thus, yields are to be avoided.},

It has the attractive property that it side-steps the need to specify the costs of the different kinds of misclassification. However, the simple form is only applicable to the case of two classes. We extend the definition to the case of more than two classes by averaging pairwise comparisons. This measure reduces to the standard form in the two class case. We compare its properties with the standard measure of proportion correct and an alternative definition of proportion correct based on pairwise comparison of classes for a simple artificial case and illustrate its application on eight data sets. On the data sets we examined, the measures produced similar, but not identical results, reflecting the different aspects of performance that they were measuring. Like the area under the ROC curve, the measure we propose is useful in those many situations where it is impossible to give costs for the different kinds of misclassification.}

  abstract = {Orchard pre-harvest yield data is important for fruit growers, which can be used for economic benefit evaluation, management mode adjustment and so on. However, traditional manual operation by sampling estimation is quite an onerous and time-consuming task. The main approach of automatic yield monitoring is by establishing multi-information comprehensive prediction systems or using intelligent equipment. A review is performed to investigate and analyze the past 12~years (from 2010 to 2021) of research work regarding orchard yield prediction and estimation. According to our investigation, the most widely used input features in yield prediction systems are various vegetation indices information of plants, while machine learning is the most modeling method applied. In addition, machine vision systems based on image processing and deep learning have been developed rapidly in the field of agriculture and is also widely applied in orchard yield prediction. Finally, major challenges and countermeasures for orchard yield prediction and estimation are discussed. Complicated natural environments with inconsistent horticultural management practices are still critical challenges for large scale commercialization of researched yield prediction methods. Therefore, combination of engineering technology optimization and standardization of agronomic management practices are necessary to realize automatic operation in complex agricultural fields. The review is intended to summarize the development of yield prediction and estimation technologies and provided suggestions for orchard intelligent management.},

  abstract = {Greenhouses and indoor farming systems play an important role in providing fresh and nutritious food for the growing global population. Farms are becoming larger and greenhouse growers need to make complex decisions to maximize production and minimize resource use while meeting market requirements. However, highly skilled labor is increasingly lacking in the greenhouse sector. Moreover, extreme events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can make farms temporarily less accessible. This highlights the need for more autonomous and remote-control strategies for greenhouse production. This paper describes and analyzes the results of the second ``Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge''. In this challenge, an experiment was conducted in six high-tech greenhouse compartments during a period of six months of cherry tomato growing. The primary goal of the greenhouse operation was to maximize net profit, by controlling the greenhouse climate and crop with AI techniques. Five international teams with backgrounds in AI and horticulture were challenged in a competition to operate their own compartment remotely. They developed intelligent algorithms and use sensor data to determine climate setpoints and crop management strategy. All AI supported teams outperformed a human-operated greenhouse that served as reference. From the results obtained by the teams and from the analysis of the different climate-crop strategies, it was possible to detect challenges and opportunities for the future implementation of remote-control systems in greenhouse production.},

Data from Australian vineyards were examined and compared with international data to identify the sources of GHG emissions in viticulture. These were also compared with other annual and perennial agricultural crops to evaluate the relative emissions from viticulture. Fuel and electricity use are significant contributors to the total GHG emissions from viticulture (approximately 98\%), with nitrous oxide emissions being low. The greatest opportunity to reduce GHG emissions from viticulture is the reduction of carbon-based energy sources. Nitrous oxide emissions may be further reduced by modifying the timing of nitrogen fertiliser application. Soil carbon sequestration opportunities also exist, namely compost and mulch application; however, increase in soil carbon is only expected after many years of treatment.},

  abstract = {Abstract The management of environmental problems is multifaceted, requiring varied and sometimes conflicting objectives and perspectives to be considered. Bayesian network (BN) modeling facilitates the integration of information from diverse sources and is well suited to tackling the management challenges of complex environmental problems. However, combining several perspectives in one model can lead to large, unwieldy BNs that are difficult to maintain and understand. Conversely, an oversimplified model may lead to an unrealistic representation of the environmental problem. Environmental managers require the current research and available knowledge about an environmental problem of interest to be consolidated in a meaningful way, thereby enabling the assessment of potential impacts and different courses of action. Previous investigations of the environmental problem of interest may have already resulted in the construction of several disparate ecological models. On the other hand, the opportunity may exist to initiate this modeling. In the first instance, the challenge is to integrate existing models and to merge the information and perspectives from these models. In the second instance, the challenge is to include different aspects of the environmental problem incorporating both the scientific and management requirements. Although the paths leading to the combined model may differ for these 2 situations, the common objective is to design an integrated model that captures the available information and research, yet is simple to maintain, expand, and refine. BN modeling is typically an iterative process, and we describe a heuristic method, the iterative Bayesian network development cycle (IBNDC), for the development of integrated BN models that are suitable for both situations outlined above. The IBNDC approach facilitates object-oriented BN (OOBN) modeling, arguably viewed as the next logical step in adaptive management modeling, and that embraces iterative development. The benefits of OOBN modeling in the environmental community have not yet been fully realized in environmental management research. The IBNDC approach to BN modeling is described in the context of 2 case studies. The first is the initiation of blooms of Lyngbya majuscula, a blue-green algae, in Deception Bay, Australia where 3 existing models are being integrated, and the second case study is the viability of the free-ranging cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) population in Namibia where an integrated OOBN model is created consisting of 3 independent subnetworks, each describing a particular aspect of free-ranging cheetah population conservation.

Consequently, intuitive predictions are insensitive to the reliability of the evidence or to the prior probability of the outcome, in violation of the logic of statistical prediction. The hypothesis that people predict by representativeness was supported in a series of studies with both naive and sophisticated university students (N = 871). The ranking of outcomes by likelihood coincided with the ranking by representativeness, and Ss erroneously predicted rare events and extreme values if these happened to be representative. The experience of unjustified confidence in predictions and the prevalence of fallacious intuitions concerning statistical regression are traced to the representativeness heuristic.

  abstract = {Wine grapes need frequent monitoring to achieve high yields and quality. Non-destructive methods, such as proximal and remote sensing, are commonly used to estimate crop yield and quality characteristics, and spectral vegetation indices (VIs) are often used to present site-specific information. Analysis of laboratory samples is the most popular method for determining the quality characteristics of grapes, although it is time-consuming and expensive. In recent years, several machine learning-based methods have been developed to predict crop quality. Although these techniques require the extensive involvement of experts, automated machine learning (AutoML) offers the possibility to improve this task, saving time and resources. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for robust prediction of grape quality attributes by combining open-source AutoML techniques and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for vineyards obtained from four different platforms-two proximal vehicle-mounted canopy reflectance sensors, orthomosaics from UAV images and Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery-during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons. We investigated AutoML, extending our earlier work on manually fine-tuned machine learning methods. Results of the two approaches using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Theil-Sen and Huber regression models and tree-based methods were compared. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) were included in the analysis and different combinations of sensors and data collected over two growing seasons were investigated. Results showed promising performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Spectrosense+ GPS data in predicting grape sugars, especially in mid to late season with full canopy growth. Regression models with both manually fine-tuned ML (R\&sup2; = 0.61) and AutoML (R\&sup2; = 0.65) provided similar results, with the latter slightly improved for both 2019 and 2020. When combining multiple sensors and growth stages per year, the coefficient of determination R\&sup2; improved even more averaging 0.66 for the best-fitting regressions. Also, when considering combinations of sensors and growth stages across both cropping seasons, UAV and Spectrosense+ GPS, as well as V\&eacute;raison and Flowering, each had the highest average R\&sup2; values. These performances are consistent with previous work on machine learning algorithms that were manually fine-tuned. These results suggest that AutoML has greater long-term performance potential. To increase the efficiency of crop quality prediction, a balance must be struck between manual expert work and AutoML.},

We quantify the economic impacts of climate change on agriculture through changes in both quantity and quality, where quality is measured by crop grades. Our model controls for methodological issues regarding sample selection, aggregation, phenology, and nonlinearity. The empirical application to Japanese rice production indicates that temperature effects are asymmetric: quantity is especially vulnerable to cold, whereas quality is vulnerable to extremely high temperature. Using these results, we simulate the effect of global warming, and we find that warming (a 3 {$^\circ$}C increase) increases farm revenues by improving yield but decreases revenues as a result of deteriorating quality. The net effect is negative, suggesting that quality matters more than quantity. The negative effect, however, can be mitigated by shifting cultivation periods and/or regions. Overall, our results suggest that the estimated impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies could be severely misleading unless quality is considered.},

This paper, set in the context of the Australian wine industry, explores different firm resources that are beneficial for environmentally sustainable development and examines the role of management attitudes and norms in moderating this relationship. It establishes which resources small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should invest in to be more successful in following environmental principles. The findings of a survey of the owner-managers of Australian wine-producing SMEs are reported, and partial least squares structural equation modelling is utilized to analyze the data. Results clearly indicate that successful firms that manage their resources more effectively influence the application of environmental behaviour, with one distinct resource significantly influencing the disclosure of such behaviour. A moderating effect is established which supports the notion that pro-environmental decision-making in SMEs is heavily influenced by the attitudes and norms held by management.},

  abstract = {Sustainability as a policy concept has its origin in the Brundtland Report of 1987. That document was concerned with the tension between the aspirations of mankind towards a better life on the one hand and the limitations imposed by nature on the other hand. In the course of time, the concept has been re-interpreted as encompassing three dimensions, namely social, economic and environmental. The paper argues that this change in meaning (a) obscures the real contradiction between the aims of welfare for all and environmental conservation; (b) risks diminishing the importance of the environmental dimension; and (c) separates social from economic aspects, which in reality are one and the same. It is proposed instead to return to the original meaning, where sustainability is concerned with the well-being of future generations and in particular with irreplaceable natural resources---as opposed to the gratification of present needs which we call well-being. A balance needs to be found between those two, but not by pretending they are three sides of the same coin. Although we use up natural resources at the expense of future generations, we also generate capital (including knowledge) which raises future well-being. A major question is to what extent the one compensates for the other. This debate centres around the problem of substitutability, which has been cast into a distinction between `weak' and `strong' sustainability. It is argued that these two do not need to be in opposition but complement one another.},

  abstract = {The wine industry is definitely committed in sustainability: the stakeholders' interest for the topic is constantly growing and a wide number of sustainability  programs have been launched in recent years. Most of these programs are focusing  on the environmental aspects as environmental sustainability indicators,  greenhouse gases emissions and the use of Life Cycle Assessment methodology.  Among the environmental indicators the carbon and the water footprint are often  used. These indicators, while being useful to assess the sustainability  performance of the winegrowing farms, do not take into account important aspects  related to the agronomic management of the vineyard. To fill this gap a new  indicator called "Vigneto" (Vineyard in Italian language) has been developed.  "Vigneto" is a multidimensional indicator to evaluate the sustainability of  management options adopted at field scale. It considers the main agronomic  aspects, which can have an impact on the environment. These include (i) pest  management, (ii) soil management (erosion and compaction), (iii) fertility  management (soil organic matter management and fertilizer application), (iv)  biodiversity management. Those aspects have been related by fuzzy logics and  implemented in web GIS software. The application of the model allows obtaining a  general judgment of the agronomic sustainability of the vineyard management: the  judgment varies from "A" (excellent) to "E" (completely unsustainable). The  produced model was validated and tested by four Italian wine estate. The model  output reports that the tested wineries have different management strategies:  producers manage vineyards in different ways, depending on the different  geographical position. The main differences are related to the soil management  and to the presence of natural areas different from vineyard. The developed model  can be defined as an environmental decision support system that can be used by  wine companies' technicians to define the vineyard practices sustainability  performance and support them in the definition of more sustainable management  practices.},

  abstract = {Climate influence on grapevine physiology is prevalent and this influence is expected to increase with climate change. Climate influence on grapevine physiology can vary depending on the terroir. A better understanding of these local terroir variations is likely to be achieved with analyses that use local data; i.e., farm/vineyard data. Thus, the challenge lies in exploiting farm data to enable grape growers to understand their own terroir and consequently adapt their practices to the local conditions. In such a context, this article proposes an analytical process to site-specifically study climate influence on grapevine physiology by focusing on time series of the weather data often contained in farm data sets. This article focuses on temperature and precipitation influence on yield in the form of a case study. The analytical process includes the Extended Growing Degree Days (eGDD) and the Bayesian functional Linear regression with Sparse Steps functions (BLiSS) methods in order to detect site-specific periods of strong climate influence on grapevine yield. It uses data from three commercial vineyards situated in the Bordeaux region (France), California (USA) and Israel. In general, the periods of climate influence on grapevine yield detected for the three vineyards identified the same stages of yield development, which have already been studied in the scientific literature. However, some vineyard differences were observed, including: i) different periods of influence associated with a given stage of yield development between the vineyards, ii) different influential weather variables between the three vineyards for a given period, and iii) differing duration of the period of influence associated with a given stage of yield development between the vineyards. These results show the potential of the proposed analytical process for analysing the time series of farm weather data in order to extract site-specific climate indicators of grapevine yield.},

  abstract = {Grapevine yield is defined as the quantity of harvest, expressed as either grape mass or wine volumeunits, which has been collected per surface unit are and per crop cycle. The information about current and future yield, termed a yield assessment in this paper, is an essential decision-making element for the grape and wine industry. Crop management, wine-making, commercial, accounting and strategic operations are all adapted to and all impact on the expected yield of the current vintage. Numerous yield assessment approaches have been proposed in the scientific literature. However, only a few of them have considered their adaptation to the operational context under the constraints, needs and strategies of commercial vineyards and wineries. The few studies that have worked on the operational implementation of yield assessment methods have only partially addressed this issue, concentrating their improvement efforts on a single step in the yield assessment process. This paper first proposes to review the characteristics of yield development in an operational context that must be taken into account by yield assessment methodsThese characteristics are consolidated into three main challenges for yield assessment methods: (i) addressing the complex temporality of yield development, (ii) ensuring a local monitoring of yield development and (iii) fitting to the operational needs and constraints to allow for relevant decision support systems in the field. The approaches of yield estimation, prediction and forecast are discussed in the context of these challenges. In a second step, the paper proposes a generic framework for the yield assessment process, including a review of the variables that are used to explain grapevine yield. Issues and proposals from the literature associated respectively with measurement, sampling and yield modelling are reviewed and the need for improved modelling of relationships between explanatory variables and the desired, reported yield variable is discussed. The yield assessment methods found in the literature are categorised and compared according to measurement, estimation and modelling approaches, and then according to the three challenges identified for yield assessment in operational conditions, such that the yield assessment method is adapted to commercial needs and not to research objectives. In conclusion, concrete proposals for new grape yield assessment methods are discussed in order to investigate the as yet unexplored opportunities for the improvement in yield assessment in operational contexts that have been identified in the paper. These considerations could easily be transposed to other perennial crops.},

  abstract = {Spotted lanternfly (SLF) is an invasive insect in the Northeastern U.S. projected to spread nationally and globally. While SLF is a significant pest of vineyards, little is known about the pest in grape agroecosystems including its spatial ecology. SLF spatial patterns were analyzed using a combination of approaches including generalized linear mixed effect models, Moran's I statistic for spatial clustering, and Empirical Bayesian Kriging. Analysis revealed that SLF displayed significantly clumped distributions in monitored vineyards. Approximately 54\% and 44\% of the respective adult and egg mass populations were observed within the first 15 m of the vineyard edge. Importantly, the spatial concentration of adults at the edge was consistent temporally, both between years and weeks. Moreover, high populations of SLF on vines were significantly correlated with reduced fruit production in the following year. Mark-release-recapture of SLF revealed that higher proportions of SLF were recaptured on vines with high pre-existing SLF populations, indicating that SLF may exhibit aggregation behavior along vineyard perimeters. Monitoring and management efforts for SLF should be prioritized around vineyard edges as it may significantly reduce infestations and subsequent damage.},

However, traditional manual operation by sampling estimation is quite an onerous and time-consuming task. The main approach of automatic yield monitoring is by establishing multi-information comprehensive prediction systems or using intelligent equipment. A review is performed to investigate and analyze the past 12 years (from 2010 to 2021) of research work regarding orchard yield prediction and estimation. According to our investigation, the most widely used input features in yield prediction systems are various vegetation indices information of plants, while machine learning is the most modeling method applied. In addition, machine vision systems based on image processing and deep learning have been developed rapidly in the field of agriculture and is also widely applied in orchard yield prediction. Finally, major challenges and countermeasures for orchard yield prediction and estimation are discussed. Complicated natural environments with inconsistent horticultural management practices are still critical challenges for large scale commercialization of researched yield prediction methods. Therefore, combination of engineering technology optimization and standardization of agronomic management practices are necessary to realize automatic operation in complex agricultural fields. The review is intended to summarize the development of yield prediction and estimation technologies and provided suggestions for orchard intelligent management.}

It expresses a purely internal state; there is no ``right,'' ``correct,'' or ``objective'' probability residing somewhere ``in reality'' against which one's degree of belief can be compared. In many circumstances, however, it may become possible to verify the truth or falsity of the proposition to which a probability was attached. Today, one assesses the probability of the proposition ``it will rain tomorrow.'' Tomorrow, one looks at the rain gauge to see whether or not it has rained. When possible, such verification can be used to determine the adequacy of probability assessments.Winkler and Murphy (1968b) have identified two kinds of ``goodness'' in probability assessments: normative goodness, which reflects the degree to which assessments express the assessor's true beliefs and conform to the axioms of probability theory, and substantive goodness, which reflects the amount of knowledge of the topic area contained in the assessments. This chapter reviews the literature concerning yet another aspect of goodness, called calibration.If a person assesses the probability of a proposition being true as .7 and later finds that the proposition is false, that in itself does not invalidate the assessment. However, if a judge assigns .7 to 10,000 independent propositions, only 25 of which subsequently are found to be true, there is something wrong with these assessments.},

However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into \&ldquo;black box\&rdquo; approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.},

Data from Australian vineyards were examined and compared with international data to identify the sources of GHG emissions in viticulture. These were also compared with other annual and perennial agricultural crops to evaluate the relative emissions from viticulture. Fuel and electricity use are significant contributors to the total GHG emissions from viticulture (approximately 98\%), with nitrous oxide emissions being low. The greatest opportunity to reduce GHG emissions from viticulture is the reduction of carbon-based energy sources. Nitrous oxide emissions may be further reduced by modifying the timing of nitrogen fertiliser application. Soil carbon sequestration opportunities also exist, namely compost and mulch application; however, increase in soil carbon is only expected after many years of treatment.},

  abstract = {Powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator) is a fungal disease causing significant loss of grape yield in commercial vineyards. The rate of development of this disease varies annually and is driven by complex interactions between the pathogen, its host, and environmental conditions. The long term impacts of weather and climate variability on disease development is not well understood, making the development of efficient and durable strategies for disease management challenging, especially under northern conditions. We present a probabilistic, Bayesian learning network model to explore the complex causal interactions between environment, pathogen, and host for three different susceptible northern grape cultivars in Quebec, Canada. This approach combines environmental (weather, climate), pathogen (development stages), and host (crop cultivar-specific susceptibility) factors. The model is evaluated in an operational forecast mode with supervised and algorithm model learning and integrating Global Forecast System (GFS) Ensemble Reforecasts (GEFSR). A model-guided fungicide spray strategy is validated for guiding spray decisions up to 6 days with a 10-day forecast of potential spray efficacy under rain washed off conditions. The model-guided strategy improves fungicide spray decisions; decreasing the number of sprays, and identifying the optimal time to spray to increase spray effectiveness.},

  abstract = {There is a growing awareness surrounding the importance of maintaining and increasing soil organic carbon (SOC, henceforth) stocks in vineyard systems.  Increasing SOC positively influences numerous soil properties and has the added  advantage of removing atmospheric CO(2), thereby helping to mitigate the effects  of climate change. Cover crops have long been used to influence soil properties  in vineyard mid-rows, including increasing SOC content. Few studies, however,  have quantified cover crop influence on SOC stocks and composition in the  under-vine area, owing to a general reluctance to adopt under-vine cover crop  management. This research aims to quantify SOC stocks and dissolved organic  carbon (DOC) in soils from four treatments of under-vine management practice  including two cover crop combinations, a straw mulch and herbicide-managed  control across two vineyard sites established in 2014. We sampled soils  under-vine to depths of 0-30 cm (stratified; 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm) and quantified  both SOC concentrations and bulk density to ascertain SOC stocks. Further to  this, we quantified water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) as a measure of the  labile carbon stock, and measured heterotrophic respiration in a laboratory  incubation as an indication of SOC turnover. We found that cover crop-managed  soil under-vine sequesters up to 23\% more soil organic carbon (SOC) as the  traditional, herbicide practice over a five-year period of growth. Microbial  activity increased by more than double in cover crop soils, owing to an increase  in DOC and that there is evidence for more resistant C in cover crop soils. These  results suggest that cover crop management under-vine is a viable solution to  increase SOC stocks within vineyard systems. Taken together, the results of this  study indicate that a shift from bare earth to cover crops in the under-vine  region has the potential to sequester carbon in vineyard soils.},

  abstract = {In the last decade there has been an exponential growth of research activity on the identification of correlations between vegetational indices elaborated by UAV imagery and productive and vegetative parameters of the vine. However, the acquisition and analysis of spectral data require costs and skills that are often not sufficiently available. In this context, the identification of geometric indices that allow the monitoring of spatial variability with low-cost instruments, without spectral analysis know-how but based on photogrammetry techniques with high-resolution RGB cameras, becomes extremely interesting. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of new canopy geometry-based indices for the characterization of vegetative and productive agronomic parameters compared to traditional NDVI based on spectral response of the canopy top. Furthermore, considering grape production as a key parameter directly linked to the economic profit of farmers, this study provides a deeper analysis focused on the development of a rapid yield forecast methodology based on UAV data, evaluating both traditional linear and machine learning regressions. Among the yield assessment models, one of the best results was obtained with the canopy thickness which showed high performance with the Gaussian process regression models (R2\,=\,0.80), while the yield prediction average accuracy of the best ML models reached 85.95\%. The final results obtained confirm the feasibility of this research as a global yield model, which provided good performance through an accurate validation step realized in different years and different vineyards.}

  abstract = {Governments employ a range of policy instruments to encourage landholders to adopt land management practices that reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture. While the impact of policy instruments may be well-theorised, their implementation in diverse contexts and landholders' complex behavioural responses, makes measurement and prediction of the resulting adoption rates difficult. This constrains the ability of governments to select the optimal combination of policy instruments. We used a participatory modelling approach to incorporate expert knowledge into a Bayesian network model exploring the effect of different policy combinations on the adoption of sustainable farming practices in the Great Barrier Reef catchment, Australia. The model integrates policy instruments including regulating farming practices, offering financial incentives, and facilitating extension programs to educate and assist farmers. Results showed that the effectiveness of a policy instrument on practice adoption was expected to vary depending on which other instruments are implemented, the characteristics of the land managers, the surrounding social context, and the practice itself. This approach demonstrates the utility of Bayesian networks in integrating high-level multi-disciplinary knowledge to address complex environmental policy decisions such as water quality management in the Great Barrier Reef.},

  abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds readers' knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling. Web Resource The book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

Grape berry ripening is a complex process, and predicting the quality of wine starting from the ripening kinetics of grape berries is a challenging task. To tackle this problem, we present a decision-support system based on coupling expert know-how with probability laws encapsulated in a probabilistic model, a dynamic Bayesian network. The proposed approach predicts the ripening kinetics of grape berries starting from initial measurements and weather conditions, and then exploits the information to evaluate the potential of the wine that will produced from them. The results show that the dynamic Bayesian network predicts the total acidity concentration and the sugar content of the grape berries with a small amount of error (mean of 6\% for total acidity concentration, 10\% for sugar content) that is considered satisfying by the experts, making it possible to predict the ideal moment for harvesting the grapes up to two weeks in advance. Moreover, feeding the results from the probabilistic model to a fuzzy expert model, the predicted trajectories are compared to an ideal trajectory described by wine experts and formalized mathematically. From this comparison, it is possible to anticipate drifts in wine sensory quality right from the step of grape ripening.},

  abstract = {Organic viticulture is an effective cultivation method that can reduce the environmental impacts of grape growing while maintaining profitability. For some vineyards, simple adjustments can suffice to make the conversion to organic farming; however, for most, major changes in system structure and management must be implemented. Here, we showed for the first time that converting to organic viticulture impacts vineyard complexity. We used six complexity indicators to assess modifications to cropping system structure and management: number of fields, number of difficult-to-manage fields, vineyard area, number of field interventions, number of technical management sequences, and number of management indicators. These six indicators were assessed through interviews carried out with winegrowers from 16 vineyards between 2008 and 2012. Changes in vineyard performances during conversion were also measured. We demonstrate that conversion to organic viticulture increased the complexity of vineyard structure and management for the 16 vineyards surveyed. While this increase allowed agronomic performances in all vineyards to be maintained, it also came with an increase in labor requirements (of up to 56\%) compared to conventional agriculture. We conclude that the six indicators are appropriate for assessing changes in vineyard complexity and could be extended to all agricultural systems to better anticipate the implications of organic farming conversion for a farm's biophysical, technical, and decisional subsystems.}

  abstract = {Currently, the wine industry has gained great relevance worldwide. At the same time, the sustainability of the business activity has positioned itself as one of the main challenges to be achieved in the coming years. Due to the great impact that agricultural processes can have on the environment, vine and wine production is particularly susceptible to the application of new technologies and processes that improve its sustainability in the medium and long term, while allowing the improvement of product quality. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the academic literature in the field of wine industry sustainability, to determine the main contributions carried out, as well as the most prominent authors, universities, and countries in this field of study. The methodology used is bibliometric analysis, specifically the Bibliometrix\&reg; R package, in its version 4.1.1. The results reveal that research in the field of sustainability in the wine industry has increased considerably in the last three years by several leading researchers, mainly from universities located in wine-producing regions. It is concluded that research shows a trend towards collaboration among stakeholders, especially in terms of innovation, which is postulated as the main tool to improve the sustainability of the sector in the coming years.},

A 3-year study was carried out in a 15-year-old `Cabernet Sauvignon' non-irrigated vineyard. Three treatments were compared: soil tillage (control), permanent resident vegetation, and permanent sown cover crop. The sward treatments induced changes in the weed dynamics by increasing annual and perennial grasses and perennial broad-leaved species, while annual broad-leaved species spread and persisted under a tillage system. Compared to soil tillage, the two sward treatments showed a higher water use, primarily during the spring. In the third season of the experiment, compared to cultivation treatment the two sward treatments showed a significant, favourable reduction in vine vegetative growth. The sward treatments did not affect grapevine yield or berry sugar accumulation compared to the control, but reduced must acidity and increased berry skin total phenols and anthocyanins.},

  abstract = {Research and policies aimed at biodiversity conservation in agricultural ecosystems are often less successful than expected. One common assumption is that more research is needed to develop improved measures and indicators of biodiversity. The authors' opinion is that this is only partly true and that most of the problems arise from the lack of a well-focussed approach to this subject. Based on the knowledge available in the scientific literature, a methodological framework was developed which can help researchers and policy makers to think in a better, more structured way about issues related to biodiversity conservation in a given agroecosystem. In order to frame the importance of biodiversity in agroecosystems, three main questions were addressed through literature search: (1) What does biodiversity mean in natural and agricultural ecosystems? (2) How is the concept of functionality used in relation to biodiversity? (3) Which biodiversity measures are currently used to express agriculture--biodiversity relationships? Analysis of the literature resulted in a framework consisting of three steps. At first the objectives of biodiversity research and policies have to be defined. Three options can be foreseen here: (a) species, community, habitat or overall biodiversity conservation regardless of its functions, (b) biodiversity conservation to attain production and environmental protection services, and (c) use of bio-indicators for agroecosystem monitoring. In the second step the appropriate target elements for conservation have to be chosen based on an agroecosystem approach, and in the third step adequate biodiversity measures of composition, structure and function have to be selected for each target element. Functional biodiversity is important in relation to the provision of specific agroecosystem services. The study of functional biodiversity should start with the definition of agroecosystem functional groups comprising all elements that interact with the desired service, and the consequent determination of the role of diversity within these functional groups for the fulfilment of the agroecosystem service. Therefore a more precise definition of `functional biodiversity' would be ``that part of the total biodiversity composed of clusters of elements (at the gene, species or habitat level) providing the same (agro)ecosystem service, that is driven by within-cluster diversity''.},

  abstract = {Wine production is an important industry in Western Switzerland, but vineyards must contend with grape vine and grape berry moths, the larval stages of which feed on grape flower buds and berries. This paper proposes a stochastic model for prediction of the emergence times of the moths, in order to aid treatment aimed at their control. Observed moth counts are treated as a realization of an inhomogeneous Poisson process whose probabilities are related to the distribution of time to emergence. We use a hierarchical model to account for the variability of this distribution between sites and years. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian fitting of the model to data are described, the latter using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, and the Bayesian approach is used for forecasting in future years. Grape vine moth flights proved much more variable than grape berry moth flights among sites and years; depending on the site, the flights of the two species can overlap or be completely distinct. Credibility intervals are provided for each site for a random future year, and the predictions can be updated and refined once 15--20\% of the flight for a new year has emerged. The paper ends with discussion of the role of such models in similar applications.},

We applied these algorithms in a real-world medical data set containing information about patients with cancer,where we learn models that try to predict the type of cancer of the patient, given their set of medical activity records.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}We explored different algorithms based on neural network architectures using long short term deep neural networks, and random forests. Since there is a growing need to provide decision-makers understandings about the logic of predictions of black boxes, we also explored different techniques that provide interpretations for these classifiers. In one of the techniques, we intercepted some hidden layers of these neural networks and used auto encoders in order to learn what is the representation of the input in the hidden layers. In another, we investigated an interpretable model locally around the random forest's prediction.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}Results show learning an interpretable model locally around the model's prediction leads to a higher understanding of why the algorithm is making some decision. Use of local and linear model helps identify the features used in prediction of a specific instance or data point. We see certain distinct features used for predictions that provide useful insights about the type of cancer, along with features that do not generalize well. In addition, the structured deep learning approach using auto encoders provided meaningful prediction insights, which resulted in the identification of nonlinear clusters correspondent to the patients' different types of cancer.}

A generalization of the analysis of variance is given for these models using log-likelihoods. These generalized linear models are illustrated by examples relating to four distributions; the Normal, Binomial (probit analysis, etc.), Poisson (contingency tables) and gamma (variance components). The implications of the approach in designing statistics courses are discussed.]}

  abstract = {Abstract Soil quality, in a viticultural context, may be defined as the soil's capacity to support grapevine growth without resulting in soil degradation or otherwise harming the environment. In other agricultural systems, various approaches for evaluating soil quality have been adopted, and numerous soil physical and chemical properties have been used to characterise it. Here, we consider the relevance and suitability of these approaches and the choice of soil properties for Australian viticulture. As a consequence, the soil physical and chemical properties suggested to comprise a minimum data set for ongoing monitoring of soil quality in Australian viticulture are aggregate stability, air-dry soil consistence, pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity (if pHCa?},

Taking a qualitative approach, this exploratory study allows us to observe the phenomenon in a natural setting. Eleven interviewees were selected from wineries based in France and Italy. The study reveals that sustainability is an important issue in wine businesses that shapes the business model. Highlighting the environmental aspects of wine production, the four components of a business model, i.e., performance, resources, innovation, and value creation (PRIV), have emerged from the interviews. The sustainability and environmental issues are reflected in business models in the wine industry. The paper explains how these components of a business model work together to ensure sustainability practices by wine producers. This study proposes a model for future applications in winery businesses. The paper helps to understand that wine producers are very keen on environmentally friendly wine businesses.},

  abstract = {The number of berries is one of the most relevant yield components that drives grape production in viticulture. The goal of this work was to estimate the number of actual berries per grapevine using computer vision and deep learning in commercial vineyards. Images from the visible range (RGB) were acquired from a set of 96 grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) at pea-size berry stage using a red, green and blue camera (RGB). At harvest, the number of berries and per vine was manually assessed as the ground-truth values. The algorithm involved computer vision to detect berries in the images and to extract canopy features, in order to gain information about canopy occlusion. These were used by the machine learning regression models built to estimate the number of actual berries per vine. A SegNet architecture was used to segment individual berries and several canopy related features. Four datasets were created combining the number of estimated visible berries and different canopy features. Three different regression models were tested on the four datasets. The best results were achieved with support vector regression (SVR) on a dataset including six canopy features. This method yielded a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 205 berries, a normalised root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 24.99\% and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.83 between the number of estimated and the number of actual berries per vine. The results show that the number of actual berries in grapevines can be assessed with high accuracy up to 60 days prior to grape harvest, using the developed algorithm based on computer vision and deep learning. [Display omitted] {$\bullet$}The number of actual berries was estimated per vine 60 days before harvest.{$\bullet$}Machine learning models used canopy features to overcome canopy occlusions.{$\bullet$}A Deep learning algorithm quantified visible berries and segmented canopy elements.{$\bullet$}RGB vine images were acquired on-the-go on a commercial vineyard.},

  abstract = {The time of flowering is key to understanding the development of grapevines. Flowering coincides with inflorescence initiation and fruit set, important determinants of yield. This research aimed to determine between and within-vine variability in 4-cane-pruned Sauvignon blanc inflorescence number per shoot, number of flowers per inflorescence and flowering progression using an objective method of assessing flowering via image capture and statistical analysis using a Bayesian modelling framework. The inflorescence number and number of flowers per inflorescence were measured by taking images over the flowering period. Flowering progression was assessed by counting open and closed flowers for each image over two seasons. An ordinal multinomial generalised linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) was fitted for inflorescence number, a Poisson GLMM for flower counts and a binomial GLMM for flowering progression. All the models were fitted and interpreted within a Bayesian modelling framework. Shoots arising from cane node one had lower numbers of inflorescences compared to those at nodes 3, 5 and 7, which were similar. The number of flowers per inflorescence was greater for basal inflorescences on a shoot than apical ones. Flowering was earlier, by two weeks, and faster in 2017/18 when compared to 2018/19 reflecting seasonal temperature differences. The time and duration of flowering varied at each inflorescence position along the cane. While basal inflorescences flowered later and apical earlier at lower insertion points on the shoot, the variability in flowering at each position on the vine dominated the date and duration of flowering. This is the first study using a Bayesian modelling framework to assess variability inflorescence presence and flower number, as well as flowering progression via objective quantification of open and closed flower counts rather than the more subjective method of visual estimation in the field or via cuttings. Although flower number differed for apical and basal bunches, little difference in timing and progression of flowering by these categories was observed. The node insertion point along a shoot was more important. Overall, the results indicate individual inflorescence variation and season are the key factors driving flowering variability and are most likely to impact fruit set and yield.},

  abstract = {Increasing temperatures due to climate change are leading to advances in grapevine phenology and sugar accumulation in grape berries. This study aims to (i) determine if a temperature-based model can predict the time to target sugar concentrations from 170 to 220~g/L for Vitis vinifera L., (ii) use the best model to characterise the time to the specified target sugar concentrations for a wide range of cultivars with statistical evaluation of each cultivar's parameterisation, and (iii) establish cultivar classifications based on these thermal times to the specified target sugar concentrations. The Day of the Year (DOY) to reach the specified target sugar concentrations (170, 180, 190, 200, 210 and 220~g/L) was determined from time series of sugar concentrations collected from research institutes, extension services and private companies. Models were fitted for the species Vitis vinifera L. The two best-fit models for the DOY to reach the target sugar concentrations were selected using the Akaike Criterion (AIC) (evaluates model complexity and goodness of fit within one criterion) and assessed for model efficiency (EF) and error of prediction (RMSE, root means squared error) followed by a sensitivity analysis and model validation. The models were then parameterised for individual cultivars. The best model across all target sugar concentrations was the non-linear best Sigmoid model "best SIG"' model (parameters: start date (t0)~=~86, d =-0.1294, e~=~14.87). The best linear (Growing Degree Days) model was also selected which represents the model that required the least parameters and therefore the simplest in application for winegrowers. This model was termed the ``Grapevine Sugar Ripeness'' model (GSR) (parameters: base temperature (Tb)~=~0~{$^\circ$}C, start date (t0)~=~91 or 1 April, Northern Hemisphere). Both models performed better than the Winkler and Huglin growing degree day models. Sixty-five cultivars were classified for the thermal time to one or more of the six sugar targets using these two models. Fifty percent of all combinations of cultivar and time to target sugar concentrations had EF values greater than 0.5 and RMSE values less than seven days. Confidence intervals were calculated for cultivars where there was sufficient data for the thermal time to target sugar concentrations. The classifications generated from both models provides the opportunity to implement either model to support cultivar choice in response to concerns of climate change and may provide cultivar solutions to issues of harvesting grapes at high sugar concentrations with resultant higher alcohol wines.},

Organic and biodynamic viticulture is forecast to grow at more than 11 per cent each year, yet there is little information on the benefits or otherwise that can be attributed to these systems of grape production. With industry funding, a six-year trial at McLaren Vale in South Australia investigated the changes in soil health, fruit production and wine quality. The trial results showed that organic and biodynamic production led to improved soil quality, with more soil organisms including much greater earthworm populations. Wine quality was also improved, but in the absence of price premiums, this was achieved at a financial penalty to the grower through reduced yields and increased production costs.},

  abstract = {Groundwater contamination by nitrate and other nutrients is a major problem throughout the world, often occurring as the result of anthropogenic activities, lack of management, and over-exploitation of groundwater resources. In the last few decades in the majority of the Italian regions, the nitrate concentrations in groundwater have dramatically increased, mainly as a consequence of the large-scale agricultural application of manure and fertilizers. This excessive use of chemicals and fertilizers increases the risk of surface and groundwater pollution from diffuse sources, which have an important impact on human health and the environment. Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean, the total area of the island is 25,711km2, with more than 5 million inhabitants. The terrain of inland Sicily is mostly hilly and intensively cultivated wherever it was possible, nitrate vulnerable zone about 40\% of flat areas and 5.37\% of total. The test site is located in Canicatt{\`i} (central Sicily); the current land use (grape, olive and almond cultivation) constitutes the main source of groundwater pollution. In order to investigate the effect of over-farming on groundwater quality and to indentify an appropriate methodology for pollution risk management, we have carried out a comparative study on the potential risk of contamination from nitrate of agricultural origin, according to the conventional parametrical methods used in Europe; the IPNOA parametric model (agricultural nitrates hazard index) method combined with the SINTACS and DRASTIC intrinsic aquifer vulnerability methods. All parameters used in this risk assessment were prepared, classified, weighed, and integrated in a GIS environment. For calibrating the models and optimizing and/or weighing the examined factors, the modeling results were validated by comparing them with groundwater quality data, in particular nitrate content, and with census data from the potential pollution sources. The criterion for checking this method was the correlation coefficient of each model with the nitrate concentration in the groundwater. A relative coincidence of a high nitrate concentration and risk mapping was observed, but this correlation was only significant using the SINTACS method. In fact, the final risk maps show significant differences in risk quality assessment; the DRASTIC model values show an over-evaluation of the real contest. In conclusion, the SINTACS parametric method appears to be the most suitable for constructing a relevant risk map of the contamination of these aquifers, which are considered to be typical of the Mediterranean region for their hydrogeological and hydrochemical features. {$\bullet$}Vulnerability mapping of shallow groundwater aquifer using SINTACS and DRASTIC methods.{$\bullet$}Assessment of groundwater risk combing intrinsic vulnerability and IPNOA hazard mapping.{$\bullet$}The risk maps are validated using groundwater nitrate distribution.},

The popularity of Bayesian Network modelling of complex domains using expert elicitation has raised questions of how one might validate such a model given that no objective dataset exists for the model. Past attempts at delineating a set of tests for establishing confidence in an entirely expert-elicited model have focused on single types of validity stemming from individual sources of uncertainty within the model. This paper seeks to extend the frameworks proposed by earlier researchers by drawing upon other disciplines where measuring latent variables is also an issue. We demonstrate that even in cases where no data exist at all there is a broad range of validity tests that can be used to establish confidence in the validity of a Bayesian Belief Network.},

Results indicate that viticulture and consumer transport contribute the greatest portion of wine's total impacts. Within the vineyard, nutrient management offers the greatest potential for improvement. Modeled scenarios indicate that high-yielding organic viticulture could marginally improve most measured impacts, but the provision of lighter bottles could yield even greater benefits. Scenarios in which transport modes and distances to market were varied provide strong evidence that the mode by which wine is transported is equally important to the distance that it travels.},

  abstract = {As wine supply chains become increasingly globalized, sustainability issues take on ever greater importance. This is the first study to analyse the environmental sustainability aspect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a global wine supply chain perspective, covering just over 90\% of Finland's wine imports. Lacking substantial domestic production capacity, virtually all wine consumed in Finland is imported. Finland is comparable to its Nordic neighbours, Sweden and Norway, in this respect. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was combined with sensitivity and scenario analyses to investigate GHG emissions implications from prospective policy changes. Our results spotlight differences related to wine production in the eight main wine producing countries for the Finnish market (Australia, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, South Africa, and the United States), related logistics, and all packaging types for wine used in Finland (glass bottle, Bag-in-Box, PET bottle, beverage carton, and pouch). We found an average value of 1.23\,kg CO2e for 0.75\,L wine consumed in Finland, ranging from 0.59\,kg CO2e for French wine in a bag-in-box packaging to 1.92\,kg CO2e for Australian wine in a glass bottle. After identifying the main GHG emission hotspots in the wine supply chain, our scenario analyses highlight the effects of reducing glass bottle weight, moving away from glass packaging toward bag-in-box, increasing bulk wine export volumes to Finland, and following the European Commission's Energy 2020 strategy which targets increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent. {$\bullet$}GHG emissions of Finland's global wine supply chain.{$\bullet$}Assessment of structural differences of 8 leading wine producing countries.{$\bullet$}Sensitivity analysis based on Monte-Carlo Simulation and 4 scenarios.{$\bullet$}Highest mitigation potential from increasing the share of alternative packaging.{$\bullet$}GHG reductions from change in bottling location only for distant sourcing destinations.},

Early grapevine yield forecasting at satisfactory accuracy is among the major trends in precision viticulture research. Conventionally, yield is estimated manually through extrapolation right before harvest, which is mostly inaccurate, requires considerable labor as well as resources, and is often destructive. The number of flowers per vine is one of the main determinants of grapevine yield and can be used as an early indicator for viticulture yield forecasting. In the present study, a non-invasive, automated image analysis framework was proposed for quantifying flowers in unstructured RGB images of grapevine canopies. Images were automatically acquired under field conditions at night, using a mobile sensing platform equipped with artificial illumination. Due to the small shape and dense distribution of individual flowers (a few hundred per inflorescence) and the similar hue of all plant organs in the fore- and background, efficient flower quantification in images is challenging. To overcome this, we adopted a two-step segmentation approach in our algorithm. First, image regions containing inflorescences were recognized and extracted by segmenting each instance of inflorescences in the image using a mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN), followed by test-time augmentation post-processing to achieve high accuracy. Finally, individual flowers in the extracted inflorescences were detected and quantified using another Mask R-CNN model preceded by a contrast enhancement pre-processing operation. For efficient segmentation and quantification of individual flowers, a high-resolution full image was split down into smaller patches and processed in multiple iterations during inference. The algorithm yielded significant performances, with F1 score values of 0.943 and 0.903 for inflorescence segmentation and single flower detection tasks, respectively, against a test set of 75 images from three different cultivars. A determination coefficient (R2) of 0.98 and a normalized root mean square error of 12.24\% were obtained in the test set between the automatic flower number quantification and manual counts. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm constitutes a promising approach for automatically predicting yield potential in the early stages of grapevine development, and it can be used for objective monitoring and optimal management of commercial vineyards.},

  abstract = {Probability distributions of crop yields are important for understanding technological change, the effects of weather on crop production, and production risk. It can be difficult to model these distributions because they are time-varying and do not follow a particular parametric form. To overcome some of the empirical challenges inherent in yield modeling, we implement a Bayesian spatial quantile regression model for the conditional distribution of yields. The statistical model is semiparametric, borrows information across space and quantile level, and models the complete quantile process. We use the model in two empirical applications where flexible modeling of the yield distribution is essential. First, we evaluate the effects of weather across quantiles and conduct a Bayesian test of the difference in the rate of technological change at opposite ends of the yield distribution. We then derive crop insurance premium rates and compare the predictive performance of the Bayesian spatial quantile regression to other existing approaches for modeling time-varying yield distributions.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 {$^\circ$}C during the test period (DL: 1.78 {$^\circ$}C, PB: 2.03 {$^\circ$}C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables. Key Points Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) models integrate advanced empirical techniques with process knowledge We used PGDL to accurately predict lake water temperatures for various conditions PGDL performance improved significantly when pretraining data included diverse conditions generated by an existing process-based model},

  abstract = {Context Farmers are facing increasing pressure to practice multifunctional agriculture. Producing woody biomass through short rotation coppices (SRC) provides an economic opportunity for farmers to diversify their agricultural income while potentially providing environmental benefits. Objective Using multi-objective, robust optimization we investigate the extent to which SRC may help farmers to reconcile the economic objective of profit maximization with ecological concerns related to enhancing soil carbon and reducing the use of chemical inputs (nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides). Methods To evaluate the costs and benefits of SRC relative to conventional agricultural crops, we use empiric and modelled data from Bavaria, Germany. Based on this performance data our optimization model determines the best mix of land-uses (land-use portfolio) for reconciling multiple objectives under uncertainty. We compare the optimal portfolios for two decision perspectives: profit oriented (in which the decision-maker only considers economic return) and multifunctional (in which the three ecological objectives are considered in addition to economic return). Both perspectives consider that farmers seek protection against downside risks. Results and conclusions From the profit-oriented perspective, SRC was selected in the optimal portfolios (comprising 34\% of the land area) derived for more risk-tolerant decision-makers, but was absent from the portfolio optimized for a strongly risk-averse decision-maker. Instead, higher woodchip prices may be required to make SRC economically attractive for strongly downside risk-averse farmers. In contrast, SRC was selected in the multifunctional portfolio (with 24-33\% land-use shares) for all levels of risk aversion. We found that the selection of SRC helped to mitigate the financial costs of multifunctionality, increasing both the average and worst-case economic return of the multifunctional portfolio. Significance Our study reveals new insights concerning the influence of uncertainties and downside risk associated with SRC on anticipated farmer decisions and suggests that cultivating SRC can help reduce trade-offs between economic and ecological objectives.},

  abstract = {Purpose Following the urgency to curb environmental impacts across all sectors globally, this is the first life cycle assessment of different wine grape farming practices suitable for commercial conventional production in South Africa, aiming at better understanding the potentials to reduce adverse effects on the environment and on human health. Methods An attributional life cycle assessment was conducted on eight different scenarios that reduce the inputs of herbicides and insecticides compared against a business as usual (BAU) scenario. We assess several impact categories based on ReCiPe, namely global warming potential, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, terrestrial toxicity, freshwater toxicity, marine toxicity, human carcinogenic toxicity and human non-carcinogenic toxicity, human health and ecosystems. A water footprint assessment based on the AWARE method accounts for potential impacts within the watershed. Results and discussion Results show that in our impact assessment, more sustainable farming practices do not always outperform the BAU scenario, which relies on synthetic fertiliser and agrochemicals. As a main trend, most of the impact categories were dominated by energy requirements of wine grape production in an irrigated vineyard, namely the usage of electricity for irrigation pumps and diesel for agricultural machinery. The most favourable scenario across the impact categories provided a low diesel usage, strongly reduced herbicides and the absence of insecticides as it applied cover crops and an integrated pest management. Pesticides and heavy metals contained in agrochemicals are the main contributors to emissions to soil that affected the toxicity categories and impose a risk on human health, which is particularly relevant for the manual labour-intensive South African wine sector. However, we suggest that impacts of agrochemicals on human health and the environment are undervalued in the assessment. The 70\% reduction of toxic agrochemicals such as Glyphosate and Paraquat and the 100\% reduction of Chlorpyriphos in vineyards hardly affected the model results for human and ecotoxicity. Our concerns are magnified by the fact that manual labour plays a substantial role in South African vineyards, increasing the exposure of humans to these toxic chemicals at their workplace. Conclusions A more sustainable wine grape production is possible when shifting to integrated grape production practices that reduce the inputs of agrochemicals. Further, improved water and related electricity management through drip irrigation, deficit irrigation and photovoltaic-powered irrigation is recommendable, relieving stress on local water bodies, enhancing drought-preparedness planning and curbing CO 2 emissions embodied in products.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a useful aid in numerous clinical applications for diagnosis and treatment decisions. Deep neural networks have shown same or better performance than clinicians in many tasks owing to the rapid increase in the available data and computational power. In order to conform to the principles of trustworthy AI, it is essential that the AI system be transparent, robust, fair and ensure accountability. Current deep neural solutions are referred to as black-boxes due to a lack of understanding of the specifics concerning the decision making process. Therefore, there is a need to ensure interpretability of deep neural networks before they can be incorporated in the routine clinical workflow. In this narrative review, we utilized systematic keyword searches and domain expertise to identify nine different types of interpretability methods that have been used for understanding deep learning models for medical image analysis applications based on the type of generated explanations and technical similarities. Furthermore, we report the progress made towards evaluating the explanations produced by various interpretability methods. Finally we discuss limitations, provide guidelines for using interpretability methods and future directions concerning the interpretability of deep neural networks for medical imaging analysis.}

  abstract = {Soil texture, topographical data, fruit zone light measurements, yield components, and fruit composition data were taken from 125 locations in each of four Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards in the Lodi region of California during the 2017, 2018, and 2019 seasons. Data were compared against three sources of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with different spatial resolutions: Landsat 8 (LS8NDVI; 30 m), Sentinel-2 (S2NDVI; 10 m), and manned aircraft (at high resolution, HR) with the interrow removed (HRNDVI; 20 cm). The manned aircraft also captured canopy temperature (CT) derived from infrared (thermal) wavelengths (HRCT; 40 cm) for additional comparisons. HRNDVI was inversely related to HRCT, as well as to several chemical components of fruit composition including tannins and anthocyanins. While some constituents of fruit composition such as anthocyanins may be related to NDVI, canopy temperature, and/or indirect measurements collected in the field, results presented here suggest that yield and fruit composition have a strong seasonal response and therefore environmental conditions should be considered if more accurate predictions are desired. Furthermore, freely available public satellite data sources with mixed canopy and interrow pixels, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8, provided similar information related to predicting specific fruit composition parameters compared to higher resolution imagery from contracted manned aircraft, from which the interrow signal was removed. Growers and wineries interested in predicting fruit composition that accounts for spatial variability may be able to conserve resources by using publicly available imagery sources and small numbers of targeted samples to achieve this goal.},

However, the interest of PV for grape growers would be greater if its principles could also apply at a larger scale, as most growers still focus their management on a multi-field scale, not considering each field as an isolated unit. The aim of this study was to analyse whether it is possible and relevant to use PV tools to define meaningful management zones at the whole-vineyard scale. The study was carried out on a 90-ha vineyard made of 27 contiguous fields. The spatial variability of vine vigour, estimated with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), was analysed at within-field and whole-vineyard scales. The spatial variability of the vigour was significant and spatially organized whatever the considered scale. Besides, vineyard spatial variability was characterised using information on environmental factors (soil apparent conductivity and elevation) and vine response (yield, vigour and grape composition). At both scales, NDVI and measured environmental factors were used to establish a three-level classification, whose agronomic significance was tested comparing the vine response observed for each class. The analysis of high resolution information allowed the definition of classes with agronomic and oenological implications, although there was not a straightforward correspondence between the classes defined and quality. Analysing the variability at the whole-vineyard scale highlighted a trend of spatial variation associated to elevation that was hardly visible at the within-field level.},

This article presents a short list of indicators and a method that can be readily adopted by any agricultural business or region to assess sustainability, making any organization, region or crop qualitatively comparable. These indicators were proposed by 83 top-level executives in 14 group interviews conducted using our adapted nominal group technique (ANGT). Executives were sourced from wine-grape growing organisations from New World wine-producing countries that also owned vineyards, and they considered everyday management practices of farms. These indicators, grouped within three categories (economic, environmental, and social) were ranked by their importance. The method defines qualitative indicators that, in the context of distinct wine regions or crops should be quantified to maintain their relevance and usefulness.},

Certification and engagement processes for membership uptake; benefits; motives; inhibiting factors; and desirable reporting system features of viticultural sustainability programs, are all considered. Case-study results are derived from nine sustainability programs; 14 focus groups with 83 CEOs, Chief Viticulturists or Winemakers from wine grape production organizations from five countries (Australia, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States); 12 semi-structured interviews with managers either currently or formerly in charge of the sustainability programs; researcher observations; and analysis of documents. Programs were categorized by their distinct program assessment methods: process-based, best practice-based, indicator-based and criterion-based. We found that programs have been created to increase growers' sustainability, mainly through the direct and indirect education they receive and promote, and the economic benefit to their business caused by overall improvement of their operations. The main finding from this study is that the success of each of these programs is largely due to the people driving the programs (program managers, innovative growers and/or early adopters) and the way these people communicate and engage with their stakeholders and peers.}

  abstract = {Modeling plant growth, in particular with functional-structural plant models, can provide tools to study impacts of changing environments in silico. Simulation studies can be used as pilot studies for reducing the on-field experimental effort when predictive capabilities are given. Robust model calibration leads to less fragile predictions, while introducing uncertainties in predictions allows accounting for natural variability, resulting in stochastic plant growth models. In this study, stochastic model components that can be implemented into the functional-structural plant model Virtual Riesling are developed relying on Bayesian model calibration with the goal to enhance the model towards a fully stochastic model. In this first step, model development targeting phenology, in particular budburst variability, phytomer development rate and internode growth are presented in detail. Multi-objective optimization is applied to estimate a single set of cardinal temperatures, which is used in phenology and growth modeling based on a development days approach. Measurements from two seasons of grapevines grown in a vineyard with free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) are used; thus, model building and selection are coupled with an investigation as to whether including effects of elevated CO2 conditions to be expected in 2050 would improve the models. The results show how natural variability complicates the detection of possible treatment effects, but demonstrate that Bayesian calibration in combination with mixed models can realistically recover natural shoot growth variability in predictions. We expect these and further stochastic model extensions to result in more realistic virtual plant simulations to study effects, which are used to conduct in silico studies of canopy microclimate and its effects on grape health and quality.},

Prediction of changes in geographical distribution and population dynamics of insect pests will be useful for adapting pest management strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on crop production. Pest outbreaks might occur more frequently, particularly during extended periods of drought, followed by heavy rainfall. Some of the components of pest management such as host-plant resistance, biopesticides, natural enemies, and synthetic chemicals will be rendered less effective as a result of the increase in temperatures and UV radiation, and decrease in relative humidity. The rate of insect multiplication might increase with an increase in CO2 and temperature. Thus climate change might change the population dynamics of insect pests differently in different agro-ecosystem and ecological zones. Therefore, there is a need to take a concerted look at the likely effects of climate change on crop protection and devise appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of climate change on food security.},

  abstract = {Legumes are essential to meet nutrition need of growing population in Afghanistan but have low productivity under the farmer practices. With an aim to introduce improved varieties of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and mung bean (Vigna radiata) along with associated cultivation practices, a number of on-farm demonstration trials were conducted in eight districts covering three provinces to assess their performance in comparison with local practices. The data or information generation from on-farm trials is routine but remains unutilized under the commonly used analysis based on frequentist approach. This study makes use of such prior information to widen the statistical inference framework using a Bayesian approach (BA) for analysing any future on-farm trials. The statistical analysis evaluated the mean performance of the improved and local production packages and risks associated with them to meet a given target. Evaluated at the two districts during 2012, the improved variety of chickpea (Madad) yielded higher than the farmer variety (2.25--2.40 vs. 1.93--1.94 Mg/ha), while that of mung bean (Mash 2008) yielded higher than the farmer variety (1.22--1.24 vs. 0.93--0.94 Mg/ha), both with high probability. The stochastic dominance analysis showed that the recommended package with improved variety Madad has 95\% probability of achieving a target of 2 Mg/ha while such a target for local practice was around its one-third when cultivated in Baghlan-e-sannati district. Crossover in the risk curves helped to identify and quantify the region specific risk to meet a given target. BA is then recommended in the analysis of on-farm trials data.},

This study quantified and integrated key weather variables during ripening, and their influence in red wine quality in the Hunter Valley, Margaret River, Coonawarra and Barossa Valley. Methods and Results: Long-term records of published vintage scores were used as an indicator of wine quality. A {$\chi$}2 analysis was used to compare good (top 25\%) versus poor (bottom 25\%) vintages in relation to the frequency of defined weather conditions. Using maximum temperature as an example, better quality was associated with temperatures above 34{$^\circ$}C throughout most of ripening in the Hunter, below 28{$^\circ$}C in early January in the Margaret River, 28-33.9{$^\circ$}C towards harvest in Coonawarra, and below 21.9{$^\circ$}C in late January and early February and 28-30.9{$^\circ$}C towards harvest in the Barossa. Conclusion: Our quantitative assessment allows for the timing and magnitude of weather influences on wine quality on a regional basis. Significance of the Study: The improved specificity of the links between weather and wine quality will help in the development of a risk analysis framework for wine quality across Australia.},

  abstract = {Plasmopara viticola is one of the main challenges of working in a vineyard as it can seriously damage plants, reducing the quality and quantity of grapes. Statistical predictions on future incidence may be used to evaluate when and which treatments are required in order to define an efficient and environmentally friendly management. Approaches in the literature describe mechanistic models requiring challenging calibration in order to account for local features of the vineyard. A causal Directed Acyclic Graph is here proposed to relate key determinants of the spread of infection within rows of the vineyard characterized by their own microclimate. The identifiability of causal effects about new chemical treatments in a non-randomized regime is discussed, together with the context in which the proposed model is expected to support optimal decision-making. A Bayesian Network based on discretized random variables was coded after quantifying the expert degree of belief about features of the considered vineyard. The predictive distribution of incidence, given alternative treatment decisions, was defined and calculated using the elicited network to support decision-making on a weekly basis. The final discussion considers current limitations of the approach and some directions for future work, such as the introduction of variables to describe the state of soil and plants after treatment.},

Understanding the triggers of the synthesis of aromatic components and finding methods to map their variability in the field can aid management practices during the season and planning selective harvest in views of maximizing benefit. Vegetation indices have been shown to track grape colour, sugar and acidity content but it has been demonstrated that aromatic components are the main drivers of the final palate of wine and are not correlated to sugar concentration. Leaf pigments such as chlorophyll, carotenoids and anthocyanins are involved in the metabolic pathways of aroma compounds in grapes. The physiological connections between grape aromatic components and primary and secondary photosynthetic pigments suggest that they could be used to detect processes related to aroma composition. This study investigates the links between grape quality parameters such as aromatic components and image-quantified spectral indices and photosynthetic plant traits derived by physical model inversion methods. Two sets of high-spatial resolution hyperspectral and thermal imagery were collected with an unmanned platform at veraison and harvest. The variability found in the field was partly but not fully explained by the thermal-based crop water stress index as an indicator of water stress (r2= 0.51--0.58, p-value{$<$}0.01). Fluspect-CX leaf model was coupled to 4SAIL canopy model and inverted to map the main photosynthetic pigment groups and the fraction of pigments acting in photoprotection. Results obtained through radiative transfer model inversion outperformed traditional vegetation indices related to pigment content and degradation. We found statistically significant relationships between image-retrieved pigments and terpenoids responsible for wine aroma (p-value{$<$}0.005).},

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction and Aims There is a need to explain reported trends of reduced alcohol and drug (substance) use in school-aged children in Australia. This study used student survey data collected in the states of Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland to examine trends in substance use and associated influencing factors. Design and Methods Youth self-reports were examined from 11 cross-sectional surveys completed by 41?328 adolescents (average age 13.5 years, 52.5\% female) across 109 Australian communities between 1999 and 2015. Multi-level modelling was used to identify trends in adolescent reports of lifetime alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use, adjusted for age, gender, social disadvantage and minority status. Trends in influencing factors were also examined that included: individual attitudes, and family, school and community environments. Multivariate analyses estimated the main contributors to alcohol use trends. Results Alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use all fell significantly from 1999 to 2015. Higher levels of use were observed in Victoria compared to Western Australia or Queensland. Multivariate analyses identified reductions in favourable parent attitudes and lower availability of substances as direct contributors to reducing alcohol use trends. Indicators of school and family adjustment did not show similar trend reductions. Discussion and Conclusions Reductions in adolescent alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use from 1999 to 2015 were associated with similar reductions in parent favourable attitudes and availability of substances. It is plausible that a reduced tendency for parents and other adults to supply adolescent alcohol are implicated in the reductions in adolescent alcohol use observed across Australia.},

For doing so, we build upon the sequential GME model suggested by Kaplan et~al. using a specific theoretical structure describing both crop production technology and nature's residual generating mechanism in line with the multiple production relations model suggested by Murty et~al. Our empirical model is fitted into a parametric stochastic framework and it is applied to a nitrogen leaching problem in a sample of 257 small-scale greenhouse farms in Crete, Greece during the 2005--2006 cropping period. Empirical results indicate a great dispersion of individual nitrate leaching levels, which are associated with low- and high-profit margins. Improvements in nitrate leaching and fertilizer application efficiency can decrease significantly individual leaching levels providing a more cost effective way to improve water quality in the~area.},

These  heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to  systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and  of the biases to which they lead could improve judgements and decisions in  situations of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {With the help of two experts in gastrointestinal oncology from The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoekhuis, a decision-support system is being  developed for patient-specific therapy selection for oesophageal cancer. The  kernel of the system is a probabilistic network that describes the presentation  characteristics of cancer of the oesophagus and the pathophysiological processes  of invasion and metastasis. While the construction of the graphical structure of  the network was relatively straightforward, probability elicitation with existing  methods proved to be a major obstacle. To overcome this obstacle, we designed a  new method for eliciting probabilities from experts that combines the ideas of  transcribing probabilities as fragments of text and of using a scale with both  numerical and verbal anchors for marking assessments. In this paper, we report  experiences with our method in eliciting the probabilities required for the  oesophagus network. The method allowed us to elicit many probabilities in  reasonable time. To gain some insight in the quality of the probabilities  obtained, we conducted a preliminary evaluation study of our network, using data  from real patients. We found that for 85\% of the patients, the network predicted  the correct cancer stage.},

  abstract = {The management of vineyards depends on the use of plant protection agents. Regardless of the numerous environmental impacts that these pesticides generate  during their production, their dosage as pest control agents in vineyards causes  an important toxic effect that must be monitored. Copper-based inorganic  pesticides are the most widely used agents to control fungal diseases in humid  wine-growing regions. It is, however, significant that the environmental analysis  of their use through the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology does not provide  detailed information on the potential toxicity of this type of pesticides. Hence,  most studies report average values for copper characterization factors (CFs),  excluding local soil characteristics. The objective of the study was the spatial  characterization of the ecotoxicity factors of copper soil emissions as a  function of the chemical characteristics of vineyard soils located in Portugal  and Galicia (NW Spain). A multiple linear regression model was applied to  calculate the comparative toxic potential. Subsequently, CFs for copper were  calculated based on spatial differentiation considering the variable properties  of the soil within each wine appellation. The CFs obtained for the area evaluated  ranged from 141 to 5937 PAF{$\cdot$}m(3){$\cdot$}day/kg(Cu emitted), for fibric histosols (HSf)  and dystic cambisols (CMd), respectively. Moreover, the average values obtained  for Galician and Portuguese soils were 1145 and 2274 PAF{$\cdot$}m(3){$\cdot$}day/kg(Cu emitted),  respectively. The results obtained illustrate the high variability of CF values  as a function of the chemical characteristics of each type of soil. For example,  Cu soil mobility was linked to organic carbon content and pH. Finally, to  validate the representativeness of the calculated CFs, these were applied to the  results of 12 literature life cycle inventories of grape production in the area  evaluated, revealing that impact scores associated with Cu emissions can  considerably vary when spatially-differentiated CFs are implemented.},

  abstract = {Cluster thinning (CT) is a common practice to prevent overcropping in viticulture. CT affects vine balance between vegetative and productive growth and further modifies grape composition. This study investigated the effects of cluster thinning treatments applied at pea-size stage (CT-AF) and the onset of veraison (CT-V), respectively, on volatile compounds of Cabernet Sauvignon in two seasons (2013--2014). The experimental vineyard was located in the north-west of China with semi-arid and monsoon climate. CT exhibited limited effects on the evolutions of volatile compounds. CT-AF exhibited an inhibition on 6-methyl-5-heptene-2-one accumulation. There were no differences in terpene concentrations between CT-treated and control grapes regardless of CT time. Regarding C6/C9 compounds and their derivatives, CT-AF decreased nonanal concentration whilst CT-V increased (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol concentration.

  abstract = {An extensive assessment of historical trends in winegrape maturity dates from vineyards located in geographically diverse winegrape growing regions in Australia has been undertaken. Records from 44 vineyard blocks, representing a range of varieties of Vitis vinifera L., were accessed. These comprise 33 short-term datasets (average 17 years in length) and 11 long-term datasets, ranging from 25 to 115 years in length (average 50 years). Time series of the day of the year grapes attain maturity were assessed. A trend to earlier maturity of winegrapes was observed in 43 of the 44 vineyard blocks. This trend was significant for six out of the 11 long-term blocks for the complete time period for which records were available. For the period 1993--2009, 35 of the 44 vineyard blocks assessed displayed a statistically significant trend to earlier maturity. The average advance in the phenology was dependent on the time period of observation, with a more rapid advance over more recent decades. Over the more recent 1993--2009 period, the average advance was 1.7 days{$\quad$}year, whereas for the period 1985--2009 the rate of advance was 0.8 days{$\quad$}yr-1 on average in the 10 long-term vineyard blocks assessed for cross-regional comparison. The trend to earlier maturity was associated with warming temperature trends for all of the blocks assessed in the study.},

  abstract = {The Australian wine industry has achieved remarkable success during the last three decades. A key to this success has been the establishment of "Wine Brand Australia". While the majority of this success has been achieved by wineries located in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia, over the last decade the Queensland wine industry has experienced greater percentage of growth than the national average in terms of the number of producers, tonnage crushed and the value of exports -- admittedly from a very low base (0.2\% of wine grape production in 2000). The aim of the paper is to gain a better understanding of the marketing strategies and regional factors that have aided the Queensland wineries and wine regions in achieving success. The results are based on a survey of the industry and an analysis of published data. In addition, a number of targeted interviews were undertaken with industry leaders in Queensland. The finding of the study highlight the importance of destination branding in sustaining the growth and vitality of the Queensland wine industry and the need to focus on promoting wineries in Queensland as being in the tourism/service industry rather than in wine making.},

However, little is known about the impacts of international trade on progress towards achieving the SDG targets. Here we show that international trade positively affected global progress towards achieving nine environment-related SDG targets. International trade improved the SDG target scores of most (65\%) of the evaluated developed countries but reduced the SDG target scores of over 60\% of the evaluated developing countries. The SDG target scores of developed countries were higher than those of developing countries when trade was accounted for, but those scores would be lower than those of developing countries if trade were not a factor. Furthermore, trade between distant countries contributed more to achieving these global SDG targets than trade between adjacent countries. Compared with adjacent trade, distant trade was more beneficial for achieving SDG targets in developed countries, but it more negatively affected SDG target scores in developing countries. Our research suggests that enhancing the accounting for and management of virtual resources embedded in trade is essential for achieving and balancing sustainable development for all.}

  author = {Yegge, Jane Marie},
  year = {2001},
  abstract = {Twenty commercial Chardonnay wines were profiled by descriptive analysis. Of these, 10 wines that spanned the flavor space were selected. One hundred and twenty-six novice and experienced Chardonnay wine consumers rated acceptance and purchase intent for the 10 coded wines. After they were surveyed for demographic, knowledge, experience, consumption, and brand familiarity information, the consumers rated acceptance and purchase intent for the same 10 wines, which were identified and accompanied by the corresponding wine bottle. Finally, participants rated purchase intent for concepts presented on a computer screen as combinations of text or pictures depicting types of non-sensory attributes of these wines. From these data, consumer segments which had similar preferences for the wines were identified. The relative impact of sensory and packaging attributes varied with each segment. Only two of the four segments' purchase intent for the wines were significantly impacted by the wine bottle, label, and brand name. While all consumer segments were most likely to buy wines possessing low to moderate levels of oak aroma which varied in intensity in fruit and floral aromas, segments were influenced differently by specific packaging attributes. For each segment, wines rated highest in purchase intent during informed evaluations had the same packaging characteristics that concept testing showed to be most important for purchase decisions, indicating internal consumer consistency. For the two segments that were impacted the most by brand, those brands that were familiar and rated highest in importance during concept testing were also rated highest in purchase intent during informed evaluations of the wines. During concept testing, a third segment exhibited a tendency to buy wines possessing labels that described the wine as fruity. This group also rated fruity wines high in purchase intent during blind and informed evaluations. Also, concept testing revealed that a fourth group was attracted to low priced wines and labels describing oak aroma. These preferences were confirmed during informed product evaluations, as inexpensive, intense oak smelling wines were rated high in purchase intent.},

  abstract = {Drought is one of the biggest threats that affects agriculture. Based on recent climatic observations and future projections, drought continues to increase its harmful impact on agricultural productivity especially in the arid areas of Turkey. Wheat farming in these arid and semi-arid areas such as Central Anatolia depends heavily on precipitation, thus monitoring for drought is needed. The timing of precipitation is also as important as its quantity. This study makes use of a crop and location specific model developed by FAO to simulate water related variables such as evapotranspiration, water deficiency and water satisfaction index to estimate the crop yield function for rain-fed wheat production in the arid regions of Turkey. A spatio-temporal yield model is estimated by Bayesian method known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. By standardizing the simulated variables over normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), impact of drought related variables on wheat yield is studied and two variables are found. Use of NDVI, as a numeraire, comes in handy in many ways. For actual evapotranspiration estimate, it strengthens separation between evaporation and transpiration and, for water deficiency, it better represents the drought properties of farms for the terrain chosen.},

  abstract = {Although studies on the balance between yield and quality of japonica soft super rice are limited, they are crucial for super rice cultivation. In order to investigate the effects of nitrogen application rate on grain yield and rice quality, two japonica soft super rice varieties, Nanjing 9108 （NJ 9108） and Nanjing 5055 （NJ 5055）, were used under seven N levels with the application rates of 0, 150, 187.5,225, 262.5, 300, and 337.5 kg ha{\textasciicircum}-1. With the increasing nitrogen application level, grain yield of both varieties first increased and then decreased. The highest yield was obtained at 300 kg ha{\textasciicircum}-1. The milling quality and protein content increased, while the appearance quality, amylose content, gel consistency, cooking/eating quality, and rice flour viscosity decreased. Milling was significantly negatively related with the eating/cooking quality whereas the appearance was significantly positively related with cooking/eating quality. These results suggest that nitrogen level significantly affects the yield and rice quality of japonica soft super rice. We conclude that the suitable nitrogen application rate for japonica soft super rice, NJ 9108 and NJ 5055, is 270 kg ha{\textasciicircum}-1, under which they obtain high yield as well as superior eating/cooking quality.},

To solve this problem, there has been research on extracting better understandable rules from neural networks. However, most authors focus on nets with only one single hidden layer.
